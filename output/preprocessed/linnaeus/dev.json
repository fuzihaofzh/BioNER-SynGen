{"src": "Scp160p is a 1222 amino acid Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein that contains 14 copies of the hnRNP K homology ( KH ) domain , a highly conserved motif found in many proteins involved in RNA metabolism ( 1 ) .", "tgt": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae [EOS]"}
{"src": "KH domain - containing proteins appear to have diverse functions and have been identified in all kingdoms of life , including the ribosomal protein S3 from Escherichia coli ( 1 ) , Mer1p from S . cerevisiae , a meiosis - specific splicing factor ( 1 ) , MEX - 3 from Caenorhabditis elegans , presumably involved in mRNA localization during development ( 2 ) , and FMRP , the fragile - X mental retardation protein in humans ( 3 ) .", "tgt": "Escherichia coli [SEP] S . cerevisiae [SEP] Caenorhabditis elegans [SEP] humans [EOS]"}
{"src": "A partial clone of Scp160p , known as HX , was one of the first multiple - KH proteins identified ( 1 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Whole cell immunofluorescence studies have demonstrated that Scp160p localizes to the cytoplasm , with enrichment around the nuclear envelope , and what appears to be the endoplasmic reticulum ( 3 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Deletion of the SCP160 locus in yeast is not lethal , but results in a complex phenotype , including increased DNA content per cell , missegregation of genetic markers during sporulation , and abnormal cell morphology , including increased size and irregular shape ( 4 ) .", "tgt": "yeast [EOS]"}
{"src": "Observation of this phenotype led to the hypothesis that Scp160p may function in regulating ploidy during cell division .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "More recently , Weber and colleagues demonstrated in vitro RNA binding activity of Scp160p using northwestern blot analyses ; the protein was found to bind efficiently to ribohomopolymers and rRNA , but not to tRNA ( 5 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Cell fractionation studies revealed that a large percentage of Scp160p associates with membrane - pellets , and is released by treatment with either 10 mM EDTA or 500 mM NaCl ( 5 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "While these authors interpreted these results to suggest that the nuclear envelope / ER localization of Scp160p was due primarily to interactions of the protein with membrane - bound polyribosomes , clear evidence of this association has not been reported ( 5 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Currently , the relationship between the phenotype of scp160 null mutants and the RNA - binding activity of Scp160p remains unclear .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "While all of the vigilin proteins studied to date are reported to bind nucleic acid , both the type of nucleic acid bound and the functional significance of these interactions remain unclear .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "For example , Kruse and colleagues reported from their work with human cells in culture that vigilin may be involved in the binding and transport of tRNA ( 9 - 11 ) .", "tgt": "human [EOS]"}

{"src": "Lastly , DDP1 , the Drosophila homolog of vigilin , was reported recently to interact with the dodeca - satellite repeat regions of centromeric heterochromatin in embryonic and larval cell nuclei , suggesting a possible role for this protein in heterochromatin structure ( 8 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "We have demonstrated that Scp160p in cytoplasmic lysates is associated predominantly with polyribosomes , and that following treatment with EDTA , Scp160p remains in an RNase / NaCl - sensitive complex of apparent molecular weight approximately > = 1300 kDa .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Affinity purification of this complex revealed the presence of poly ( A ) - binding protein ( Pab1p ) , a well - characterized component of eukaryotic mRNPs ( 14 , 15 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "DISCUSSION", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The data presented here demonstrate two main points regarding the biochemical associations and function of Scp160p in yeast .", "tgt": "yeast [EOS]"}
{"src": "First , the sucrose gradient fractionation data clearly demonstrate that Scp160p exists primarily associated with large complexes , likely to be polyribosomes .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "To our knowledge , this is the first time a vigilin family member has been shown to associate with polyribosomes in this manner .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Interestingly , Weber and colleagues did not observe sucrose gradient fractionation data consistent with polyribosome association of Scp160p ( 5 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "These authors hypothesized that Scp160p associates only with membrane - bound polyribosomes , and that Scp160p is not found complexed with cytosolic polyribosomes ( 5 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Our data do not support this hypothesis , since unlike Weber and colleagues , we were able to detect significant amounts of Scp160p associated with polyribosomes without using detergents during preparation .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "There are several possible explanations for this discrepancy .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "First , the lysate buffer utilized by that group contained 100 mM NaCl , whereas our buffer contained 50 mM KCl .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Our data shown in Figure 3 suggest that 100 mM NaCl may have caused an instability in the Scp160p - RNA interaction , leading to release from polyribosomes during their procedure .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Secondly , Weber ' s lysate buffer reportedly contained heparin to inhibit ribonucleases ; a number of reports ( 28 , 29 ) suggest that heparin can disrupt RNA - protein interactions .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Although we have not in the past included heparin in any of our experiments , we have observed disruption of the polyribosome association in buffer containing residual diethylpyrocarbonate , another inhibitor of ribonucleases ( data not shown ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Second , our data provide compelling evidence that Scp160p is released from polyribosomes as a component of an mRNP complex .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Since Scp160p does not remain associated with either single ribosomes or ribosomal subunits following treatment with EDTA or RNase , it seems unlikely that Scp160p is a constitutive component of the translational machinery .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Partial purification of the EDTA - resistant Scp160p complexes allowed us to demonstrate the presence of Pab1p but not Pub1p in these preparations , which is consistent with the idea that Scp160p associates with polyribosomes as a component of mRNP complexes .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Previously , Scp160p had been shown to bind ribohomopolymers and rRNA in vitro , although the in vivo nucleic acid targets of Scp160p were unknown ( 5 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The presence of Pab1p in RNase - sensitive Scp160p complexes indicates that Scp160p is primarily bound to polyadenylated RNAs .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Whether or not Scp160p binds only specific sets of mRNAs will be the subject of future studies .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In addition to Scp160p and Pab1p , we have identified a third component of the complex , the protein Bfr1p .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The gene , BFR1 , was originally identified in a screen for high - copy suppressors of Brefeldin - A induced lethality , suggesting a role in the secretory pathway ( 16 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Interestingly , however , bfr1 null mutants do not demonstrate any defects in the secretory pathway , but rather display similar phenotypes to scp160 null mutants , most notably increased ploidy and increased cell size ( 16 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "It is therefore unclear whether Bfr1p is capable of functioning in both RNA metabolism and secretion directly , or if the Scp160p - Bfr1p complex regulates the expression of one or more secretory genes at the post - transcriptional level .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Additionally , two - hybrid analysis indicated an interaction of Bfr1p with the protein Bbp1p , a component of the mitotic spindle apparatus ( 30 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "While Bbp1p is an essential gene , overexpression leads to a phenotype similar to both bfr1 and scp160 null strains ( 30 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Future work will address the functional relationship between Scp160p and Bfr1p including the possibility that these proteins represent a regulatory mechanism connecting the translational machinery with cell division and / or the secretory pathway .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Following treatment with either RNase or > 150 mM NaCl , Scp160p remained as an apparent ~ 450 kDa species .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Considering that purified Scp160p alone also migrates at this size , we conclude that this apparent complex may consist only of Scp160p , although the presence of other small components cannot be ruled out at this time .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Furthermore , by utilizing yeast co - expressing two distinct epitope - tagged versions of Scp160p , we have ruled out the possibility of self - association of Scp160p .", "tgt": "yeast [EOS]"}
{"src": "Although both tagged proteins appear functional , it remains a formal possibility that the tags somehow prevented formation of FLAG - HA hetero - complexes .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Nonetheless , it seems most likely that native Scp160p monomers may simply migrate aberrantly under native conditions due to an unusual shape or some other physical property .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In conclusion we have shown convincing evidence that Scp160p exists in yeast cytoplasmic extracts primarily associated with polyribosomes .", "tgt": "yeast [EOS]"}
{"src": "We have purified Scp160p following disruption of polyribosomes with EDTA , and identified two associated proteins : Pab1p and Bfr1p .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The presence of Pab1p suggests that Scp160p associates with polyribosomes as a component of an mRNP , demonstrating Scp160p to be the first S . cerevisiae multiple - KH domain protein characterized to function in this way .", "tgt": "S . cerevisiae [EOS]"}

{"src": "Heterochromatin protein 1 ( HP1 ) was the first protein identified in Drosophila melanogaster as a heterochromatin - associated protein ( 3 ) ; the corresponding gene has been cloned from a number of organisms and is highly conserved from yeast to human ( 4 ) .", "tgt": "Drosophila melanogaster [SEP] yeast [SEP] human [EOS]"}
{"src": "Polytene chromosome staining showed that , in Drosophila , HP1 is distributed mainly in pericentric heterochromatin , telomeric heterochromatin , the banded small fourth chromosome ( 5 - 8 ) , as well as ~ 200 individual loci scattered throughout the euchromatic chromosomal arms ( 5 ) .", "tgt": "Drosophila [EOS]"}
{"src": "The gene encoding HP1 in D . melanogaster , Su ( var ) 2 - 5 , was isolated as a suppressor of PEV ( 9 - 11 ) .", "tgt": "D . melanogaster [EOS]"}
{"src": "The protein contains a highly conserved motif , the chromo ( chromatin organization modifier ) domain , similar to Polycomb ( Pc ) , a repressor of homeotic genes ( 12 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The association between HP1 and pericentric heterochromatin is believed to occur via the chromo domain of HP1 and the N - terminal tail of histone H3 methylated at lysine 9 ( 13 , 14 ) , generated by histone methyltransferase - Su ( var ) 3 - 9 , a partner of HP1 in pericentric heterochromatin ( 15 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The C - terminal chromo ' shadow ' domain of HP1 interacts with other silencing complexes to suppress local transcriptional activity ( 15 - 18 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , studies of HP1 chromosomal distribution also showed that HP1 does not always co - localize with lysine 9 methylated histone H3 or Su ( var ) 3 - 9 , especially in euchromatic regions ( 19 - 21 ) ; in some cases , HP1 is found directly bound to DNA ( 22 , 23 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "All these features argue for distinct roles for HP1 in chromatin and in epigenetic gene regulation .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "DISCUSSION", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In this study , we used microarray and RT - PCR techniques to demonstrate that transcription of cell - cycle regulators is misregulated in the absence of HP1 .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Certain defects in S phase may be a direct consequence of the loss of transcription of DNA replication genes such as McM2 , McM5 , McM6 , CDC45L , Orc4 and others , since these genes have been functionally implicated in the initiation of DNA replication and / or the progression of replication forks ( 39 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Depletion or mutation of these genes has been shown to result in DNA damage ( 32 ) , the blockage of replication forks ( 39 ) , increased chromosome loss / genome instability , and defective condensation ( 30 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The reduction in the number of cells in G2 / M phase may be a consequence of the reduction in transcription or functional disruption of INCENP , Aurora B , Bub1 , and Bub3 ( 34 , 36 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Chromosome segregation defects , such as chromosome fragmentation and chromatin bridges in anaphase / telophase cells , and certain cytokinesis defects in HP1 - depleted cells , mimic the phenotype of cells with loss function of INCENP , Aurora B or Bub1 ( 35 - 37 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The mislocalization of Aurora B in the absence of HP1 is also consistent with the loss of transcription and functional disruption of INCENP ( 37 ) , and the reduction in Aurora B transcription may be partially responsible for the observed chromosomal defects , including loss of histone H3 phosphorylation at serine 10 .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "HP1 is also known to physically interact with certain components of replication complexes such as ORCs and MCMs ( 30 , 40 , 41 ) , with the inner centromere protein INCENP ( 42 ) and the chromatin assembly factor CAF1 ( 43 ) promoting delivery of HP1 to heterochromatin sites ( 44 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Loss of HP1 is , therefore , expected to cause disruption to such HP1 - associated complexes , and will partially contribute to the chromatin / chromosomal defects in HP1 mutants ( 8 , 27 ) and HP1 - depleted Kc cells .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "It is therefore well possible that the loss of transcription of these cell - cycle regulator genes , and consequent disruption of HP1 functional complexes or heterochromatin structure , all contributed to the cell - cycle defects observed .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The ChIP assay supports the hypothesis that the loss of transcription of cell - cycle regulator genes is a direct effect of the lack of HP1 .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Aurora B , McM3 , and McM5 were all bound by HP1 at their promoter regions , although other cell - cycle regulators , such as McM7 , were HP1 - negative , implying that the altered transcription in these genes might be a secondary effect of the loss of HP1 .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "A previous study in Drosophila Kc cells ( 20 ) employed an approach based on the ectopic expression of a fusion protein of HP1 with a prokaryotic DNA adenine methyltransferase and identified a number of methylated targets in the genome .", "tgt": "Drosophila [EOS]"}
{"src": "In this study , MCM3 and MCM5 were not found to be methylated , indicating lack of association with HP1 .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "On the other hand , heterochromatin repeats , such F - element and 1360 , were consistently found to be HP1 - enriched both here and in the previous study .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "It remains to be determined whether these discrepancies are due to the different experimental systems used .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , we note that the previous study was performed using a cDNA array , while we observe binding of endogenous HP1 at the promoter of these genes .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Similarly , another study using chromatin immunoprecipitation in larvae also showed few HP1 - positive genes that were not detected in Kc cells by the Dam ID approach ( 21 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "A large number of genes affected by the loss of D . melanogaster HP1 in larval tissues ( 21 ) seem to be different from that in embryonic Kc cells .", "tgt": "D . melanogaster [EOS]"}
{"src": "The change in the transcription of Aurora B and few cell - cycle regulators reported in this study is also not found among the HP1 - affected genes at larval stage ( 21 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This may be due to specific role ( s ) of HP1 in different stages of development .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Alternatively , it is also possible that the impact of HP1 in the transcription of cell - cycle regulators in proliferating cells is underestimated when performing the analyses on larval tissues , and thus on mixed populations of both proliferating and differentiating / differentiated cells .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "HP1 is generally known as a transcriptional repressor , as supported by several lines of evidence : silencing of a euchromatic reporter gene in heterochromatin requires HP1 ( 10 , 11 ) , tethering of HP1 next to a euchromatic reporter gene causes silencing ( 45 ) , and the repression of genes within euchromatic region 31 bound by HP1 is relieved in the absence of HP1 ( 46 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In contrast , genes in heterochromatin , known as heterochromatic genes , such as light and rolled , seem to require HP1 to maintain their active transcription ( 47 , 48 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The level of transcription of heterochromatic genes was dramatically reduced in a mutated HP1 background ( 47 - 49 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "It was therefore proposed that HP1 may function as a positive regulator of transcription of these genes ( 50 , 51 ) , although the exact regulation mechanism remains unclear .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "A study of heat - shock genes found that HP1 is associated with RNA transcripts in the coding region , and is also a positive regulator of their transcription ( 52 , 53 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The chromatin association of HP1 at the promoter region of active euchromatic genes demonstrated from this work and others , and its independence from histone H3K9 methylation ( 21 ) , all suggest that mechanism whereby HP1 modulates transcription of euchromatic genes is potentially distinct from its role in heterochromatin formation .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Collectively , the results of this study demonstrate that HP1 plays an essential role in cell - cycle progression , and support the view that HP1 , in addition to its role in heterochromatin , can act as a positive transcriptional regulator of euchromatic genes .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Discussion", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Our results and the literature suggest a hypothesis on modifying carcinogenesis mechanisms .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The primary effect of the toxic agents , including carcinogenic agents , may relate to cellular membrane damage with the subsequent increased permeability ( 31 - 35 ) , which may be the mechanism of the o - cresol .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "With simultaneous introduction of o - cresol at low toxic doses and BaP there may be increased carcinogen penetration to the target cells .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In addition , membrane damage may alter other cellular systems responsible for energy and xenobiotic detoxication .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Considering the toxic effect of o - cresol at low toxic doses ( 1 mg ) after BaP and the effect of a super toxic dose ( 10 mg ) simultaneously with BaP administration , it is possible that the inhibition of carcinogenesis in both trials was related to the toxic effects of o - cresol .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Conclusions", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The data obtained demonstrate that simultaneous administration of BaP modifies the induced carcinogenesis depending on the dose and the sequence of administration .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Administered with BaP ( 1 mg ) , a low toxic o - cresol dose ( about minimally effective ) produces an enhanced cocarcinogenic effect reflected in the incidence , frequency , multiplicity , and degree of malignancy of forestomach tumors .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "o - Cresol administration at low toxic doses before or after BaP at the same dose level ( 1 mg ) and its administration at super toxic doses ( 10 mg ) with the BaP optimal dose ( 5 mg ) may inhibit carcinogenesis .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Simultaneous introduction of a noneffective o - cresol dose ( 0 . 02 mg ) with the BaP ( 1 mg ) does not change its carcinogenic activity .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "These percentages may be underestimates of the true prevalence of anti - BLyS autoantibodies , because some of these autoantibodies may be saturated in vivo with circulating BLyS , rendering them incapable of binding to BLyS in the in vitro detection assay .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We do not yet know whether the anti - BLyS autoantibodies are functionally neutralizing but , regardless , such autoantibodies could enhance the clearance of BLyS and / or interfere with in vitro detection of BLyS , thereby masking endogenous BLyS overproduction .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Second , increased urinary excretion of BLyS has been reported in SLE patients , especially among those with clinically overt renal involvement [ 26 ] .", "tgt": "patients [EOS]"}
{"src": "At least four of the patients we studied manifested nephrotic - range proteinuria ( > = 3 g / 24 hours ) , and so urinary loss of BLyS was probably substantial in at least these patients .", "tgt": "patients [SEP] patients [EOS]"}
{"src": "A validated assay for urinary BLyS detection has not yet been developed so we were unable to quantify urinary BLyS levels .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Once an assay for urinary BLyS levels is validated , we should be able to assess the effect of urinary BLyS excretion on circulating BLyS levels .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Third , BLyS promotes in vivo expansion of B cells [ 1 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Freshly isolated SLE B cells , despite intact surface expression of BLyS receptors , bind less biotinylated BLyS ex vivo than do freshly isolated normal B cells [ 27 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Although other interpretations are possible , the most likely explanation is that BLyS receptors on B cells in SLE patients are occupied in vivo by soluble BLyS .", "tgt": "patients [EOS]"}
{"src": "Accordingly , it is likely that BLyS receptors expressed by the expanded B cell population do bind BLyS and remove it from the circulation , resulting in a homeostatic pathway that modulates the effects of BLyS overproduction on circulating BLyS levels .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Indeed , circulating levels of BLyS rise with peripheral blood B cell depletion and fall with re - emergence of peripheral blood B cells in rituximab - treated RA or SLE patients [ 28 , 29 ] , highlighting this inverse relationship between circulating BLyS levels and B cell load .", "tgt": "patients [EOS]"}
{"src": "Moreover , one of the hallmarks of active disease in human SLE is the increased percentages of activated B cells and plasma cells in peripheral blood [ 30 - 34 ] , probably reflecting increased systemic numbers of activated B cells and plasma cells .", "tgt": "human [EOS]"}
{"src": "Although not yet formally tested , differential BLyS receptor expression by these cells compared with expression by nonactivated B cells may result in increased peripheral BLyS utilization , further dampening the effects of BLyS overproduction on circulating protein levels .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "To circumvent these confounding processes , we used BLyS mRNA levels as a surrogate marker of endogenous BLyS production .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Overall , the correlations between disease activity and either full - length BLyS or Delta BLyS mRNA levels were much stronger than that between disease activity and BLyS protein levels ( Figures 3 and 4 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This was the case regardless of whether we used the standard SLEDAI or the modified SLEDAI as a measure of disease activity .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "These correlations were not spurious ones consequent to shifts in percentages of leukocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood , because BLyS mRNA levels did not correlate with percentages of blood neutrophils , monocytes , or lymphocytes ( Figure 5 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "A similar pattern was observed between plasma immunoglobulin levels and the BLyS parameters , with plasma levels of total immunoglobulin , IgG , and IgA correlating significantly with full - length BLyS and Delta BLyS mRNA levels but not with plasma BLyS levels ( Figure 2 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "These significant correlations between full - length BLyS or Delta BLyS mRNA levels and plasma immunoglobulin levels again highlight the greater ability of BLyS mRNA levels , compared with plasma BLyS protein levels , to reflect ongoing BLyS overproduction .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "At present , it is not known whether soluble Delta BLyS protein is present in the circulation of SLE patients or of normal individuals .", "tgt": "patients [EOS]"}
{"src": "Although full - length BLyS protein is readily cleaved and released from cells transfected with a vector containing murine full - length BLyS , Delta BLyS protein is not cleaved or released from murine Delta BLyS transfectants [ 11 ] .", "tgt": "murine [SEP] murine [EOS]"}
{"src": "Given the strong similarities between murine and human full - length BLyS and Delta BLyS , it is likely that human soluble Delta BLyS protein is also not cleaved from the cell surface and released into the circulation .", "tgt": "murine [SEP] human [SEP] human [EOS]"}
{"src": "Moreover , soluble Delta BLyS protein is not released from cells transfected with a vector containing just the extracellular domain of human Delta BLyS ( which encodes the soluble protein ; A . L . Gavin , unpublished observations ) .", "tgt": "human [EOS]"}
{"src": "Whether this reflects rapid intracellular degradation of soluble Delta BLyS or some other impediment to its release remains unknown .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Regardless , if the inability to release soluble Delta BLyS in vitro faithfully recapitulates in vivo biology , then the stronger associations between SLE disease activity and full - length BLyS or Delta BLyS mRNA levels compared with that between SLE disease activity and BLyS protein levels could not be attributable to interference by biologically inactive ( inhibitory ) Delta BLyS protein in the BLyS protein detection ELISA .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Importantly , even if soluble Delta BLyS protein is present in the circulation and is detected by the BLyS protein detection ELISA , then the stronger correlations between SLE disease activity and full - length BLyS or Delta BLyS mRNA levels than that between disease activity and total BLyS ( including Delta BLyS ) protein levels suggest that full - length BLyS and / or Delta BLyS mRNA levels may operationally serve as useful biomarkers of disease activity in SLE .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Although the complexity and labor intensiveness associated with quantitative real - time PCR may render measurement of BLyS mRNA levels impracticable for routine clinical practice , such measurement could readily be incorporated into clinical trials and yield valuable information .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Longitudinal observations in large numbers of SLE patients will be necessary to establish or refute the utility of full - length BLyS and / or Delta BLyS mRNA to subserve this clinically vital function .", "tgt": "patients [EOS]"}
{"src": "Although expression of the two major BLyS isoforms was highly coordinate among SLE patients , there were several patients in whom Delta BLyS mRNA levels were markedly greater than or less than the expected values based on full - length BLyS mRNA levels ( data not shown ) .", "tgt": "patients [SEP] patients [EOS]"}
{"src": "This raises the possibility that dysregulation of Delta BLyS may contribute to overall BLyS dysregulation in at least some SLE patients .", "tgt": "patients [EOS]"}
{"src": "It is known that interferon - gamma , interleukin - 10 , interferon - alpha , and CD154 can upregulate full - length BLyS mRNA levels [ 14 , 22 , 35 ] , but it is not known what effects these or other cytokines / cell - surface structures have on Delta BLyS expression .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Further investigation of the regulation of Delta BLyS and the differential expression of BLyS isoforms is certainly warranted .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Although the associations between full - length BLyS and / or Delta BLyS mRNA levels and disease activity in SLE were usually strong when the SLE cohort was analyzed in aggregate , there were several SLE patients in whom BLyS mRNA levels were quite high despite little objective ongoing disease activity , and there were several SLE patients in whom BLyS mRNA levels were low despite considerable ongoing disease activity .", "tgt": "patients [SEP] patients [EOS]"}
{"src": "One must recognize that the bulk of the pathogenic autoimmune responses probably takes place in the spleen and lymph nodes , rather than in the peripheral blood , where myeloid lineage cells ( for example , dendritic cells ) produce BLyS and support B cell survival and expansion [ 36 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Local BLyS production in the secondary lymphoid tissues will be more important to the development and maintenance of an autoimmune response than will remote BLyS levels in the circulation .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Because at least some autoreactive B cells may be more sensitive to BLyS - mediated survival signals than non - autoreactive B cells [ 37 , 38 ] , local increases in BLyS production could preferentially promote expansion of autoreactive B cells .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "These cells , in turn , could activate autoreactive T cells by presenting autoantigen to them , and some of the autoreactive B cells would respond to T cell derived signals and mature into ( pathogenic ) autoantibody secreting plasma cells .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In contrast to murine studies , in which investigators can readily harvest and analyze lymphoid and myeloid lineage cells from any site ( for example , spleen , bone marrow ) , such is not the case for human studies .", "tgt": "murine [SEP] human [EOS]"}
{"src": "Peripheral blood is the only site readily accessible for human studies , and it is possible that , at least in some patients , BLyS mRNA levels in circulating leukocytes do not reflect local BLyS production in the secondary lymphoid tissues .", "tgt": "human [SEP] patients [EOS]"}
{"src": "One must also recognize that disease activity in SLE is not solely driven by B cells .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Systemic inflammation and SLE flares can be triggered via B cell independent means .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Not all SLE patients treated with a B cell depleting course of rituximab experience clinical remission [ 39 ] , strongly pointing to the importance of non - B cells in disease pathogenesis / maintenance .", "tgt": "patients [EOS]"}
{"src": "Conversely , not all pathogenic B cells necessarily require high levels of BLyS to effect their pathogenicity .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Murine studies have unequivocally documented B cell subpopulations that do not depend upon BLyS for their survival [ 40 - 42 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Although mice completely devoid of BLyS have reduced numbers of mature B cells and harbor reduced levels of immunoglobulin , these reductions are incomplete .", "tgt": "mice [EOS]"}
{"src": "Thus , it is possible that some SLE patients harbor pathogenic B cells that are relatively insensitive to BLyS and could drive considerable disease activity even in the context of low endogenous BLyS production .", "tgt": "patients [EOS]"}
{"src": "Conversely , patients with high BLyS mRNA levels may be those patients whose disease is strongly driven by BLyS and may be especially helped by BLyS antagonist therapy .", "tgt": "patients [SEP] patients [EOS]"}
{"src": "Future clinical trials should be able to establish whether the BLyS mRNA levels are good predictors of response to such agents .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Conclusion", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Plasma total immunoglobulin , IgG , and IgA levels and disease activity ( as measured by SLEDAI ) in SLE patients correlate more closely with peripheral blood leukocyte levels of BLyS mRNA than with plasma levels of BLyS protein .", "tgt": "patients [EOS]"}
{"src": "These findings suggest that BLyS mRNA levels better reflect in vivo BLyS production than do circulating BLyS protein levels , and may be a useful biomarker in the clinical monitoring of SLE patients .", "tgt": "patients [EOS]"}
{"src": "These findings also support the premise that BLyS overexpression not only promotes development of disease but also actively contributes to the ongoing maintenance of disease in SLE patients .", "tgt": "patients [EOS]"}

{"src": "Conclusions", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The risk of venous thrombosis after travel is moderately increased for all modes of travel .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Subgroups exist in which the risk is highly increased .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Background .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Recently there has been increasing concern that blood clots ( thromboses ) in the leg or lungs occur with greater frequency after air travel .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Several theories have been put forward to explain why this increase might happen , including the fact that air passengers tend to not move around much , or possibly that reduced amounts of oxygen in the blood make the blood more likely to clot .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Understanding what causes such clots is important as it would help us come up with suggestions of ways to prevent them .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Why Was This Study Done ?", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "It is not possible to test in a controlled trial whether travel causes an increase in blood clots , so the next best way of studying this problem is to do a case - control study , in which people with blood clots ( cases ) are compared with similar people who don ' t have a blood clot ( controls - - in this case , the partners of the cases ) , and the differences in a number of contributing factors are assessed .", "tgt": "people [SEP] people [EOS]"}
{"src": "What Did the Researchers Do and Find ?", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Since 1999 , the MEGA ( Multiple Environmental and Genetic Assessment of Risk Factors for Venous Thrombosis ) study has aimed to identify all people in an area of the Netherlands who develop a blood clot for the first time , by seeking out people who receive treatment for blood clots .", "tgt": "people [SEP] people [EOS]"}
{"src": "At the time of this report , 1 , 906 people with clots had been found ; of these , 233 had traveled for more than four hours in the eight weeks preceding the event .", "tgt": "people [EOS]"}
{"src": "Traveling in general was found to increase the risk of clots two - fold , and the risk was highest in the week after traveling .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The risk of flying was similar to the risk of traveling by car , bus , or train , and was highest in the first week after traveling .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Certain other factors increased the risk of a blood clot even more , such as having a particular mutation ( known as factor V Leiden ) in a gene involved in blood clotting , having a body mass index of more than 30 kg / m2 ( over 30 kg / m2 is defined as being obese ) , being more than 1 . 90 meters tall , and using oral contraceptives .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "All these factors made the risk of clots especially after air travel worse ; in addition , people shorter than 1 . 60 meters also had an increased risk of thrombosis after air travel .", "tgt": "people [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , it should be borne in mind that the number of cases in each of these various groups was quite small , and the overall risk of getting a thrombosis is still low .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "What Do These Findings Mean ?", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Since the risks of thrombosis are increased for all types of long travel , it seems that the main factor causing the thrombosis is immobility .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , since the risk is even higher for air travel , the relative lack of oxygen may also play a part .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "One interesting aspect of this study is that the researchers used partners as controls ; in order to be sure that doing this did not make the results invalid , the researchers had to carefully adjust for differences between the cases and controls , such as the fact that partners were generally of the opposite sex .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Discussion", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The results obtained in the present study suggest that the ability to compensate the secretion of E2 by the missing ovary is different between the right and left ovaries and varies during the estrous cycle .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Similarly , our results suggest that the cholinergic system participates in regulating E2 secretion by the ovary , and that such participation varies depending on the ovary remaining in situ and the stage of the estrous cycle when the surgical procedure was performed .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Previously , we suggested the existence of a neural pathway arising from the peritoneum that participates in regulating E2 [ 9 ] , P4 [ 10 ] and testosterone secretion [ 11 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In the rat , the sensory information arising from the peritoneum is sent to the nucleus tractus solitarius and stimulates neurokinine - B receptors [ 17 ] .", "tgt": "rat [EOS]"}
{"src": "Since perforating the peritoneum unilaterally on each day of the estrous cycle changed E2 serum concentrations , we think that each side of the peritoneum sends different neural information through the superior ovarian nerve ( SON ) to the ovary and the central nervous system , perhaps reaching nuclei related to the vagus nerve .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "A study analyzing the distribution of sensory neurons innervating the peritoneum showed that when tracer was placed on the area where the peritoneum covers the abdominal wall , labeled neurons were observed only in the ipsilateral dorsal root ganglia [ 18 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The authors suggest that most of the parietal peritoneum receives sensory nerves from dorsal root ganglia , and visceral peritoneum from both , the spinal and vagus nerves .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "According to Stener - Victorin et al .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "( 19 ) repeated electro - acupunture treatments in rats with polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCO ) , induced by a single injection of estradiol valerate , resulted in lower nerve growth factor ( NGF ) concentrations at the ovarian level than in non - electro - acupunture treated PCO rats .", "tgt": "rats [SEP] rats [EOS]"}
{"src": "In our experiments , perforating the peritoneum affected the same somatic segments employed by Stener - Victorin et .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "al .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "[ 19 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We presume that peritoneum surgery resulted in an increase of NGF concentrations at the ovarian level , which in turn induced hyper - androgenism , as observed in women with PCO [ 20 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Previously , we showed that the unilateral perforation of the peritoneum results in a significant increase in testosterone serum concentrations [ 11 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Because E2 serum concentrations did not increase after left or bilateral perforation of the peritoneum , we suppose that the neural information originating from the peritoneum inhibits the mechanisms regulating aromatase activity within the follicle .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "One of the ovaries ' sources of catecholamines arrives through the SON .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In the ovary , the SON fibers are mainly distributed in the peri - follicular theca layer , and in close relation with the cells of the theca interna [ 21 , 22 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Therefore , it is possible that perforating the peritoneum modifies the type and / or rate of information arriving to the ovary via the SON .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Another possibility is that perforating the left side of the peritoneum results in an increase release of ovarian gamma amino butyric acid ( GABA ) , and a subsequent increase of E2 concentrations .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "[ 26 ] , injecting GABA into pseudo - pregnant rats increases E2 concentration in the blood .", "tgt": "rats [EOS]"}
{"src": "Present results indicate that injecting ATR , before unilateral or bilateral perforation of the peritoneum , to rats in D1 or P , results in lower E2serum concentrations ; leading us to think that some of the neural fibers present in the peritoneum are muscarinic .", "tgt": "rats [EOS]"}
{"src": "It is also possible that blocking the cholinergic innervation , by ATR treatment , results in lower adrenaline and norepinephrine release by the adrenal medulla .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Our results , and those of others , suggest that stimulating on D2 the sensory receptors located on the left side of the peritoneum triggers an E2 secretion inhibitory mechanism , that the sensory pathway arising from the right side has a stimulatory effect , and that both are mediated by the cholinergic muscarinic system .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Previously , we showed that injecting ATR to rats in D2 results in increases of P4 serum concentrations originating from the adrenals [ 8 ] , without having apparent effects on testosterone serum concentrations [ 11 ] .", "tgt": "rats [EOS]"}
{"src": "Since P4 and androgens are precursors in the synthesis of E2 , we presume that this mechanism may explain the increase in E2 serum concentrations observed in rats with peritoneum perforation previously injected with ATR .", "tgt": "rats [EOS]"}
{"src": "Another possibility explaining the differences on E2 secretion regulation during the estrous cycle is that the effects of the cholinergic system take place through changes at the celiac ganglion level .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "According to Aguado and Ojeda [ 23 ] , acetylcholine inhibits P4 secretion in the celiac ganglion - SON - ovary preparation obtained from rats in D1 or D2 , while the preparation obtained from rats in P resulted in only a moderate stimulation .", "tgt": "rats [SEP] rats [EOS]"}
{"src": "Since there is evidence that fibers from the vagus nerve innervate neurons in the celiac ganglion [ 27 ] , we presume that the cholinergic system modulates the sympathetic post - ganglionar activity and the secretory ability of the ovaries through the SON .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Conclusion", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Based on the differences in E2 serum concentrations in rats with ULO , present results suggest that the capacity to release E2 by the left and right ovaries varies during the estrous cycle .", "tgt": "rats [EOS]"}

{"src": "In general , the construct validity of the questionnaire was supported by inter - scale correlations .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "As expected , the Bother - Physical Health , Symptoms , Fatigue / Sleep , and Activity scales were more strongly correlated to one another than with other scales .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , the Reproductive Health scale had a lower internal consistency reliability and it was weakly correlated with the ITP - PAQ scales , the SF - 36 , and the CES - D , possibly due to the differing concepts measured by the items within this scale or the all - female sample .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Most of the ITP - PAQ scales were moderately correlated with the SF - 36 scales and the CES - D ; however , correlations between some of the scales were < 0 . 40 ( e . g . , Fear and SF - 36 Mental Health , 0 . 30 ; p < 0 . 05 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "The known - groups validity results indicate that some of the ITP - PAQ scales ( Symptoms , Fatigue / Sleep , Bother - Physical Health , Activity , Psychological Health , and Overall QoL scales ) were able to differentiate ITP subjects who were currently receiving ITP treatment from those who were not receiving treatment for ITP , providing preliminary evidence of the ITP - PAQ ' s ability to distinguish between groups known to be different .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Abstract", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The relationship between parasite fitness and virulence has been the object of experimental and theoretical studies often with conflicting conclusions .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Here , we provide direct experimental evidence that viral fitness and virulence , both measured in the same biological environment provided by host cells in culture , can be two unrelated traits .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "A biological clone of foot - and - mouth disease virus acquired high fitness and virulence ( cell killing capacity ) upon large population passages in cell culture .", "tgt": "foot - and - mouth disease virus [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , subsequent plaque - to - plaque transfers resulted in profound fitness loss , but only a minimal decrease of virulence .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "While fitness - decreasing mutations have been mapped throughout the genome , virulence determinants - - studied here with mutant and chimeric viruses - - were multigenic , but concentrated on some genomic regions .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Therefore , we propose a model in which viral virulence is more robust to mutation than viral fitness .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "As a consequence , depending on the passage regime , viral fitness and virulence can follow different evolutionary trajectories .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This lack of correlation is relevant to current models of attenuation and virulence in that virus de - adaptation need not entail a decrease of virulence .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Virulence expresses the harm that parasites inflict upon their hosts .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Many studies have addressed the basis of virulence and its effect on host and parasite survival .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "It has generally been accepted that one of the components of parasite virulence is fitness , or the capacity of the parasite to multiply in its host .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Some models have equated virulence with fitness .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In the present study , we use foot - and - mouth disease virus ( FMDV ) to document that virulence and fitness - - measured in the same biological environment provided by cells in culture - - can be unrelated traits .", "tgt": "foot - and - mouth disease virus [SEP] FMDV [EOS]"}
{"src": "This has been achieved by multiplying the virus in a manner that mutations accumulated in its genome .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Mutations decreased fitness dramatically , but not virulence .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Chimeric and mutant viruses were constructed to show that virulence is influenced by only some of the FMDV genes , while fitness is influenced by the entire genome .", "tgt": "FMDV [EOS]"}
{"src": "For this reason , virulence is more robust ( \" resistant \" ) than fitness to the effects of deleterious mutations .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The fact that virulence can be unrelated to fitness has implications for the design of anti - viral vaccines because it suggests that it may be possible to design high fitness , low virulence strains to stimulate the host immune response .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Furthermore , in modelling studies it cannot be assumed that virulence is equal to fitness .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Introduction", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The relationship between fitness and virulence is an unsettled question , and sometimes fitness is considered a component of the virulence phenotype of parasites .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "RNA viruses are ideal systems to address this important question because of their high mutability and fecundity , which result in a potential for rapid evolution , and also because of the availability of quantitative fitness and virulence assays .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "RNA viruses replicate as complex and dynamic mutant spectra , termed viral quasispecies .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Key to quasispecies dynamics are mutation rates in the range of 10 - 3 to 10 - 5 substitutions per nucleotide copied , and competition among continuously arising variant genomes [ 1 - 4 ] , which prompt rapid movements in sequence space , with corresponding changes of position in the fitness landscape [ 5 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Indeed , large population passages of RNA viruses in cell culture permit competitive optimization of mutant distributions that generally result in fitness gain [ 6 , 7 ] , while repeated bottleneck events ( experimentally realized as plaque - to - plaque transfers ) lead to random accumulation of deleterious mutations ( operation of Muller ' s ratchet [ 8 ] ) and result in average fitness decreases [ 9 - 13 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Fitness recovery of low fitness foot - and - mouth disease virus ( FMDV ) clones occurs mainly with introduction of mutations along the genome , with very few true reversions .", "tgt": "foot - and - mouth disease virus [SEP] FMDV [EOS]"}
{"src": "An understanding of the consequences of fitness variation for viral virulence is a key question for viral pathogenesis and evolution .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Here , we approach this issue with FMDV , an important viral pathogen in veterinary medicine [ 14 ] , and one that fully participates of quasispecies dynamics .", "tgt": "FMDV [EOS]"}
{"src": "Our laboratory has characterized multiple FMDV variants that derive from one original biological clone , and that occupy widely different fitness levels when replicating in a defined environment in cell culture .", "tgt": "FMDV [EOS]"}
{"src": "We define fitness as the replication capacity of a mutant FMDV , relative to a reference FMDV , in direct growth - competition upon coinfection of baby hamster kidney 21 ( BHK - 21 ) cells [ 15 - 17 ] .", "tgt": "FMDV [SEP] FMDV [SEP] hamster [EOS]"}
{"src": "Fitness of FMDV in BHK - 21 cells is a multigenic trait [ 7 ] .", "tgt": "FMDV [EOS]"}
{"src": "In the present study , we define virulence of FMDV as the capacity of the virus to kill BHK - 21 cells under a standard set of cell culture conditions [ 18 ] .", "tgt": "FMDV [EOS]"}
{"src": "Thus , the FMDV - BHK - 21 system offered a means to investigate in a direct and comparative fashion the relationship between fitness and virulence of a virus , measured in the same biological environment provided by BHK - 21 cells .", "tgt": "FMDV [EOS]"}
{"src": "We describe the behavior of an FMDV clone (", "tgt": "FMDV [EOS]"}
{"src": ") , which has a history of repeated serial plaque - to - plaque transfers in BHK - 21 cells [ 11 ] , that attained a very low fitness value relative to its parental reference virus ( C - S8c1 ) , and yet , its virulence for BHK - 21 cells was significantly higher than that of C - S8c1 .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "A comparative study of the capacity to kill BHK - 21 cells of chimeric FMDVs constructed with cDNA copies of the two parental FMDVs indicates that the enhanced virulence for BHK - 21 cells of the low fitness clone is a polygenic trait , with participation of the regions encoding capsid proteins and non - structural proteins 2A , 2B , and 2C as virulence determinants .", "tgt": "FMDVs [SEP] FMDVs [EOS]"}
{"src": "Three specific amino acid replacements in 2C have been identified as redundant virulence determinants of FMDV for BHK - 21 cells .", "tgt": "FMDV [EOS]"}
{"src": "Thus , while large population passages of the virus resulted in a gain of both fitness and virulence , subsequent bottleneck passages resulted in a decrease of fitness but not of virulence .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The results suggest that fitness is very vulnerable to mutation in any genomic region .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Human skeletal growth and final height attainment are a result of a multifactorial regulation involving systemic and local hormones , growth and nutritional factors , lifestyle and genetic factors .", "tgt": "Human [EOS]"}
{"src": "Heritability estimates1 and genome - wide linkage analysis2 have shown that genetic factors play a major role in determining stature .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Among these factors , the GH - IGF - I axis plays an important role during postnatal life , and associations between structural variations in its genes and height are currently under study . 3 Although growth hormone ( GH ) deficiency is a well - known cause of growth retardation , which responds to GH replacement therapy , the diagnosis and physiopathological mechanisms for the so - called ' idiopathic isolated GH deficiency ' ( IIGHD ) require further clarification .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In addition , GH secretion levels and markers of GH biological activity have been demonstrated to be specific and sensitive only in major deficiency states . 4 , 5 Genetic causes of GH deficiency within the GH1 gene have been established ; however , they are rarely recognized and only sought in major GH deficiency states during childhood and in family studies . 3 GH1 gene , located at 17q22 - 24 , is a component of the GH gene cluster in which five genes evolving from a common ancestor are 91 - 99 % sequence conserved ( paralogues ) . 6 GH1 is more abundantly expressed in pituitary cells , while the other four genes are expressed in placental tissue .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Large deletions within the GH1 gene cluster were described first followed by point mutations , the majority of which affect introns 3 or 4 , provoke skipping of exon 3 product and exert a dominant effect . 3 , 7 , 8 More recently , the presence of single nucleotide polymorphic points ( SNPs ) in the promoter region or in intron 4 of the GH1 gene have been described9 - 12 and associations with promoter allele activities or with GH secretion efficacy and circulating IGF - I levels in growth - retarded patients have also been described . 11 , 12 Other studies have analysed several GH1 gene SNP genotypes as related to the incidence of neoplasia , with a positive association with colorectal neoplasia for intron 4 SNP , 13 a negative result for breast carcinoma14 , 15 or a positive one for breast cancer risk . 16 , 17 In addition , a recent study in a cohort of adults over ages 60 years detected a significant association between genotypes at one SNP in the GH1 gene promoter region and at the intron 4 SNP described by Hasegawa et al . 11 with baseline bone density and accelerated bone loss together with an interaction with weight at 1 year . 18 Intron 4 SNP described by Hasegawa et al . 11 has also been associated , in women , with shorter body height and reduced mortality , 19 whereas another intron 4 SNP ( T1169A ) has been associated in both sexes with a favourable metabolic profile . 20 A systematic SNP study was conducted by Adkins et al . 21 in GH1 promoter , coding and noncoding regions in DNAs from placental tissues , and analysis of associations between genotypes and birth weight revealed an association between an alternate nucleotide at - 1 and + 3 of translation initiation site and fetal growth restriction .", "tgt": "patients [SEP] women [EOS]"}

{"src": "Introduction", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The microtubule motor called cytoplasmic dynein has roles in diverse cellular processes including meiotic and mitotic spindle assembly and function , neuronal transport , and organelle positioning [ 1 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Cytoplasmic dynein is composed of a dimer of heavy chains ( HCs ) , along with several accessory chains ( ACs : intermediate , light intermediate , and light chains ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Other dynein - interacting proteins , such as dynactin and LIS1 , are likely present at substoichiometric levels and further modulate dynein function .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The HCs contain both ATPase and microtubule binding activities and are sufficient for microtubule - based motility in vitro , moving toward the minus , or slow - growing , end of microtubules [ 2 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The dynein ACs provide cargo docking sites and often are encoded by multigene families in any one species [ reviewed in 1 , 3 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In C . elegans , a single gene called dhc - 1 encodes a cytoplasmic dynein 1 HC , while 11 other genes encode five classes of predicted dynein ACs [ 3 , 4 ] .", "tgt": "C . elegans [EOS]"}
{"src": "The early C . elegans embryo is an excellent system for investigating gene contributions for essential cellular processes , including cytoskeletal functions [ 5 ] .", "tgt": "C . elegans [EOS]"}

{"src": "Analysis of fast - acting dhc - 1 temperature - sensitive ( ts ) mutants has further revealed that dynein is required for chromosome congression to the metaphase plate during mitosis , as well as for mitotic spindle positioning [ 10 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "While many requirements for cytoplasmic dynein are known , our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that target and regulate dynein remains limited .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Clearly , the multiple ACs can couple the dynein HC to particular substrates [ 11 ] , including vesicles , nuclei , viruses , kinetochores , and rhodopsin [ see table in 1 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , reducing the function of only four of the eleven dynein ACs in C . elegans produces lethal phenotypes [ 12 ] .", "tgt": "C . elegans [EOS]"}
{"src": "Thus , it remains unclear how ACs influence the different essential requirements for dynein .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Another potential route for dynein regulation involves the phosphorylation state of the different dynein chains , which in some cases confers distinctive functional properties to the motor .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "While many examples of dynein phosphorylation exist , and cell cycle dependent changes in phosphorylation have been described [ 13 - 15 ] , few if any studies have demonstrated a requirement for such modification during mitosis .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Genes that do influence dynein function might also have other essential roles , leading to pleiotropic mutant phenotypes that obscure their relationship to dynein [ 17 - 19 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Moreover , redundancy within the multigene dynein subunit families , and also perhaps between the different ACs , may complicate the identification of single gene requirements that are important for dynein function .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "The or352 allele replaces a conserved glycine with aspartic acid at codon 2158 , in the ATP - binding walker A motif of the second AAA ATPase domain ( Figure 1B and 1C ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "As both missense mutations affect conserved residues , they may prove useful for engineering ts alleles in other organisms .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The temperature versus viability curves of the dynein ts mutants feature a steep central transition zone ideal for modifier screening because subtle changes in temperature produce large changes in embryonic viability ( Figure 2A ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "To identify genes that , when reduced in function , can suppress conditional dhc - 1 mutants , we developed a high - throughput RNAi - based screen ( Figure 2B ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "To reduce gene function we used a library of 16 , 757 bacterial strains that each express a dsRNA corresponding to exon - rich gene sequences [ 17 , 19 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We then tested over 99 % of the bacterial strains in this library for RNAi - mediated suppression of dhc - 1 ( or195 ) embryonic lethality at 23 degrees C , after raising synchronized L1 larvae to adulthood on dsRNA - expressing bacterial lawns in 48 - well agar plates .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This screening procedure should work to identify nonessential and essential suppressor genes , because RNAi does not always fully reduce gene function [ 24 , 25 ] , and even if RNAi does produce lethality , cosuppression could restore viability .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Nevertheless , essential genes may be missed due to earlier requirements that produce strong larval arrest , sterile , or embryonic lethal phenotypes .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Quantification of embryonic viability using dhc - 1 ( or195 ) animals showed that the RNAi - mediated depletion of suppressor gene function increased viability to 5 % - 100 % , compared to less than 2 % in unsuppressed controls ( Figure 3A ; Table S1 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The proteins encoded by the suppressor genes we identified are summarized in Figure 4 .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "As a more direct assay for dynein activity in the suppressed dhc - 1 embryos , we measured spindle length and cytokinesis success : dhc - 1 mutant embryos have severe spindle assembly defects and subsequent cytokinesis failures [ 6 , 7 , 10 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We shifted dhc - 1 adult hermaphrodites from 23 degrees C to the fully restrictive temperature of 26 degrees C for 3 - 5 hours and made time - lapse video micrographs using Nomarski optics to monitor the first embryonic cell division .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This procedure results in dhc - 1 ( or195 ) embryos with P0 spindles 30 % the length of wild - type spindles ( Figure S1 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Specificity of Suppression", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Because RNAi can reduce the function of unintended targets ( so - called \" off - target effects \" [ 26 , 27 ] ) , we also used available mutations in some of the suppressor genes we identified to reduce their function .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "The dpy - 3 ( e27 ) and dpy - 10 ( e128 ) point mutation alleles [ 28 ] also suppressed embryonic lethality in double mutants ( Figure 3B ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Based on this small sampling , and because RNAi in C . elegans appears to be highly gene specific in the absence of close paralogs [ 12 , 19 ] , we conclude that many of the suppressors we have identified will prove to be suppressor locus specific .", "tgt": "C . elegans [EOS]"}
{"src": "The dsRNA - expressing bacterial clones we used to deplete two of the dynein suppressors ( tag - 300 and ZK1127 . 10 ) probably also knock down expression of one close paralog for each locus [ 29 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We next asked whether the suppressors are specific for dynein function or if their depletion more generally stabilizes ts proteins .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "The lit - 1 gene encodes a MAP kinase - related protein [ 30 ] , while spn - 4 encodes a protein with an RNA binding motif [ 31 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We found that ten of the dhc - 1 - interacting genes significantly increased embryonic viability in both lit - 1 and spn - 4 mutants , while 18 others suppressed one or the other of these two conditional mutants when reduced in function using the same RNAi protocol as that used for dhc - 1ts mutants ( Figure 4 , right two columns ; Table S1 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Therefore , about half of the suppressors appear to act nonspecifically on multiple ts mutants to restore embryonic viability .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "From here on , we will refer to the suppressors that only acted on dhc - 1 , and not on lit - 1 and spn - 4 ts mutants , as dynein - specific suppressors .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Because many ts mutations exert their effect via protein assembly or unfolding mechanisms [ 32 ] , suppressor genes reduced in function by RNAi might not be expected to exhibit allele specificity with most ts mutations .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "To determine if the dynein suppressors are either allele or strain specific , we tested the two other conditional dhc - 1 strains ( containing the or283 and or352 alleles ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Although the or283 allele is identical to or195 , it provides a useful control for the presence of background mutations because the two strains were isolated independently .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In most cases , depletion of the dynein - specific suppressors also restored viability to the other two ts dhc - 1 alleles .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Y40B1B . 5 , a putative translation initiation factor , suppressed only one conditional dhc - 1 strain , and we consider this as an example of a nonspecific interaction ( Figure 4 , left three columns ; Table S1 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Two dsRNAs that do not suppress lit - 1 or spn - 4 mutants produced suppression in the dhc - 1 ( or195 ) and dhc - 1 ( or283 ) strains , but not in the dhc - 1 ( or352 ) strain , perhaps indicating allele specificity or variability in the RNAi treatments .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We conclude that strain background differences are relatively rare , and that the majority of the suppressors are allele - independent .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "To summarize , we have identified 20 genes that when reduced in function specifically suppress multiple dynein ts strains but not unrelated ts loci .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Survey of Putative Dynein Accessory Chains", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We were surprised to discover that depleting two predicted dynein ACs specifically suppressed the partial loss of HC function , because most dynein accessory subunits are presumed to promote dynein function by aiding dynein complex formation or mediating cargo attachment [ 3 , 11 , 33 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Depletion of either dylt - 1 ( encoding a Tctex1 - type light chain ) or dyrb - 1 ( encoding a roadblock - type light chain ) suppressed embryonic lethality in all three ts dynein HC mutant strains ( Figure 4 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "To extend this observation , we surveyed all genes encoding predicted dynein components for suppression of the three ts dhc - 1 mutants ( Figure 5A ; Table S2 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We reasoned that some dynein subunit genes could have been missed in the primary screening and several dynein AC genes were not represented in the E . coli RNAi library .", "tgt": "E . coli [EOS]"}
{"src": "After using RNAi to reduce their function , we found that one of three Tctex1 homologs ( dylt - 1 ) , one of four LC8 homologs ( dlc - 1 ) , one of two light intermediate chains ( dli - 1 ) , as well as the sole roadblock homolog ( dyrb - 1 ) each strongly suppressed the three conditional dynein mutants .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Lower - level suppression was also seen for the second light intermediate chain , xbx - 1 , when its function was reduced .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Thus , one gene of each of four subunit classes restores viability to the three dhc - 1 mutant strains when depleted by RNAi .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The only subunit class not found to suppress was the intermediate chain , encoded by a single gene in C . elegans , dyci - 1 .", "tgt": "C . elegans [EOS]"}
{"src": "When reduced in function by RNAi , dyci - 1 produces a larval arrest phenotype like that observed for dhc - 1 ( RNAi ) ; this phenotype precludes any suppression of the conditional embryonic lethality ( shown as \" la \" in Figure 5A ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In contrast , knockdown of either dlc - 1 or dli - 1 suppresses embryonic lethality in the dhc - 1ts mutants , even though reducing their function in otherwise wild - type embryos produces dhc - 1 - like defects , including embryonic lethality [ 12 , 34 ] ( see Figure 5B and Discussion ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The suppressing cytoplasmic dynein subunits and DYCI - 1 are shown in a putative complex in Figure 5E .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We performed several genetic assays to better understand how the suppressor genes may be operating .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "We observed a striking difference between transmitted and untransmitted chromosomes within the class II region : nearly all transmitted HLA - DRB1 * 0301 haplotypes ( 99 % ) are identical across a 180 kb region defined by eight SNPs , whereas the corresponding region within untransmitted HLA - DRB1 * 0301 haplotypes exhibits significant recombination .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Furthermore , assessment of marker association in our lupus dataset demonstrates that after conditioning for HLA - DRB1 * 0301 , the only markers that retain association signals are telomeric of SKIV2L , suggesting that complement C4 , which is centromeric to this gene , may not be responsible for our independent class III signal .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "These data substantially refine that previously published by Graham et al . in 2002 [ 25 ] , where the lupus susceptibility interval within HLA - DRB1 * 0301 - containing haplotypes could only be delimited to a 1 Mb region encompassing class II and class III .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Examination of LD structure around our second independent association , rs419788 - T in class III , coupled with the results of our conditional analysis , suggests that this signal could also be delimited to a relatively narrow genomic interval of about 40 kb given further SNP mapping in our cohort .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This region includes the genes CFB , RDBP , SKIV2L , DOM3Z , and STK19 , but does not include complement C4 .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Background", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Many biological databanks , both dealing with protein sequences ( e . g . , SWISS - PROT ) and nucleotide sequences ( e . g . , GeneBank ) , contain not only primary structures of sequences ( i . e . , sequences of letters - amino acids or nucleotides ) , but also information about functions and properties of these sequences .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This information is stored in so called description fields of the sequences .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "There exist different types of description fields - KW ( KeyWords ) , DE ( Descriptions ) , . . . , FT ( Feature Table ) , . . . ; elements of description fields are referred to as words .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Words from KW , DE , . . . fields describe a sequence as a whole , while words from FT fields correspond to certain positions ( letters ) of a sequence .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The automated annotation problem can be described as follows .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Consider a biological sequence ( referred to as a query sequence ) with known primary structure ( i . e . letter sequence ) but unknown properties and functions ( i . e . , description fields ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "The annotation should be fully automated .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This is the subject of the current paper .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "There are two main approaches to the solution of this problem .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In the first approach ( it can be called a static one ) a certain fixed protein classification ( grouping proteins according to similarity in structure and / or functions ) , specified beforehand , is used : for a query protein the search of a relative group ( super family ) is performed on the basis of primary structures , and properties / functions of this group are extended to the query protein .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "An example of this approach is described in the paper by W .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Fleischmann et al .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "[ 1 ] , it uses the protein classification ( more than 1000 families ) , stored in the Prosite databank .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The second approach ( it can be called a dynamic or an adaptive one ) does not use protein classification .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Instead , a \" dynamic \" collection of bank sequences that are similar to a query sequence is generated , and then common properties / functions of these bank sequences are extended to the query sequence .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Andrade et al .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "[ 2 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In this paper the prediction was based on so called word reliability function - a function depending on the degree of similarity between a query sequence and corresponding bank sequences .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In other examples of annotation procedures based on the dynamic approach prediction was performed in a \" naive \" way - all properties / functions of similar proteins were extended to a query protein , or using stochastic methods - only properties / functions that are most frequent for the collection of similar proteins were extended ( see [ 3 , 4 ] ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The current paper uses the dynamic approach .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This paper is a sequel to paper [ 5 ] that describes the A4 algorithm ( the Adaptive Algorithm of Automated Annotation ) , so results of the paper [ 5 ] are constantly used here .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The A4 algorithm is based on a stochastic approach .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "More precisely , it is based on the notion of transfer probabilities .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Transfer probabilities are the probabilities of word transfer ( extension ) from description fields of one sequence to description fields of another sequence ; they depend on the measure of similarity between sequences .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Transfer probabilities are evaluated on the basis of word transfer frequencies in the found collection of sequences similar to a query sequence .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "For each word from description fields of sequences included in the collection the prediction of the fact that this word belongs ( or does not belong ) to the description field of a query sequence is performed ; this prediction is based on transfer probabilities .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In the current paper we introduce and analyze a number of new statistics for the prediction .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "All of them are based on the likelihood ratio criterion [ 6 ] ( which is the most powerful criterion ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "The application of an annotation procedure to an unannotated amino - acid query sequence ( i . e . , the prediction of description fields ) starts with generating a collection of sequences similar to this query sequence with known description fields .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "These similar sequences are selected from a certain databank that contains annotated amino - acid sequences , e . g . , SWISS - PROT .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "There exist different approaches to the generation of a collection of similar sequences ( see [ 7 ] ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This collections can be generated on the basis of global alignments between a query sequence and bank sequences ( global alignments can be constructed , e . g . , by CLUSTAL procedure ) using an identity percentage or , more generally , a similarity percentage as a similarity measure .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Another variant is to use local alignments ( i . e . , alignments of most similar fragments of compared sequences , see [ 7 ] ) instead of global alignments .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Local alignments can be constructed , for example , by a well - known BLAST procedure [ 7 , 8 ] , in which sum of weights or a corresponding e - value serves as a measure of similarity between fragments ( and thus between compared sequences ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Other alignment procedures are also acceptable ; alignment procedure selection does not play a critical role .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Since we build on the A4 procedure , we briefly summarize that approach .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In the A4 procedure a collection of similar sequences is generated on the basis of local alignments of a special type .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "These alignments are constructed by the DotHelix procedure ( [ 9 ] ) , in which the \" power \" ( sum of weights divided by the root of the length of the local alignment , see [ 9 , 10 ] for details ) serves as a similarity measure .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Each local alignment constructed by DotHelix procedure is a chain of closely located gapless local alignments .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Local alignments that are generated during the construction of a collection of similar sequences are referred to as primary local alignments .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Each sequence from a collection of similar sequences pi 1 , . . . , pi n can have several corresponding primary local alignments , but for the sake of simplicity we assume that each similar sequence pi i has exactly one corresponding primary local alignment , the one with the maximum similarity measure .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Let mu i denote the similarity measure ( power ) of a primary alignment that corresponds to pi i .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The value of mu i characterizes the measure of similarity between fragments that constitute this alignment ; at the same time mu i can be treated as a measure of similarity between the whole query sequence pi 0 and the whole similar sequence pi i .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Statistical decision theory tells us that the optimal prediction procedure should be based on the statistic P { H1 | xi } P { H0 | xi } or equivalently on the likelihood ratio .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Lines are ordered according to the prediction quality : higher lines correspond to statistic variants with lower total number of errors .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "For a fixed statistic , lines that correspond to the best variant of this statistic ( i . e . , for the variant that leads to the lowest total number of errors ) are marked .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Recall that the statistic T ^ ( 2 ) [ 1 , 0 ] is exactly the statistic that was considered in [ 5 ] ( note that it is the best variant for the statistic T ^ ( 2 ) ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The results could also have been presented as a confusion table as laid out in Table 3 , but doing so for all variants would take a lot of space .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The testing results showed that the first modification ( consideration of all primary local alignments or only one primary local alignment with the maximum power ) did not significantly affect the prediction quality , so results are only presented for one case ( all local alignments are considered , similarly to [ 5 ] ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Note that the results presented in the Table correspond to the whole totality of words including degenerate words ( though statistics eta , T ( 1 ) , T ( 2 ) , T ^ ( 2 ) , T ( nik ) were evaluated only for non - degenerate words , for degenerate words the prediction was performed on the basis of the statistic q , i . e . , on the basis of word frequency ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In particular , the total number of errors includes errors for degenerate words .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "It is worth noticing that the total number of errors for degenerate words in case of the best choice of threshold q0 for the frequency q ( omega ) turned out to be surprisingly small : only 13 ( whereas the number of errors for the whole totality of words was 220 ) ; these errors included twelve type 1 errors and one type 2 error ( recall that the prediction was performed for 2029 degenerate words , and the prediction was incorrect only in 13 cases ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Such a small number of errors can seemingly be explained by the fact that for degenerate words the frequency q ( omega ) is nearly always close either to 1 or to 0 , otherwise in almost all cases transfer probabilities p1 | 1 , p1 | 0 can be defined for at least some values of similarity measure mu and hence a word omega turns out to be non - degenerate .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We also note that along with type 1 and type 2 errors other errors can occur , as it is possible that some words from description fields of a query sequence do not belong to description fields of similar sequences and hence the prediction is not performed for these words at all .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , we used a large number of similar sequences ( 100 ) for the prediction , so such errors were extremely rare ( only two words for the whole test set of 518 sequences , whereas the number of words for which the prediction was performed equaled 9236 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Hence , in our case these errors can be disregarded .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Statistical analysis showed that the precision of the evaluation of N1 , N2 , Nall is reasonable : it can be checked that the relative precision of Nall ( the standard error of ln ( Nall ) ) is in the order of 7 - 10 % which is in line with the relative precision of a Poisson random variable that is given by 1 / Nall .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , since the \" methods \" ( the statistics and their variants ) are compared on the same sequences , the standard error for the comparison between methods is much smaller due to the high correlation of results for the same sequence and is in the order of 2 - 4 % .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This implies that \" methods \" for which Nall differ by more than 10 % can considered to be significantly different .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This shows that size of the experiment with 210 randomly selected sequences in the learning stage and 308 sequences in the testing stage is large enough to obtain valid statements about the accuracy of the proposed methodology and allows statistical comparisons of different statistics and variants .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "When the set of tested sequences is fixed , the total number of errors Nall is an objective characteristic of prediction quality , and the optimal threshold values ( selected during the \" learning stage \" ) provide exactly the minimum of the total number of errors .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , if different testing results ( based on different sets of query sequences ) are compared , then absolute numbers of errors can not be treated as a procedure quality measure , and relative quantities ( proportions ) should be considered instead of absolute quantities .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Usually a sum of the proportion of type 1 errors and the proportion of type 2 errors P ( 1 ) + P ( 2 ) is used as a quality measure ; values of this sum are presented in the fifth column of Table 2 .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , in our situation the number of words nall - nq that do not belong to query sequences is much larger than nq , and for the majority of these words it is obvious that they do not belong to a query sequence .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Consequently , in case of optimal parameter values the proportion of type 2 errors P ( 2 ) is small , it is considerably smaller than P ( 1 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Thus the quantity P ( 1 ) + P ( 2 ) is not representative in our case ( see [ 5 ] ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The ratio P ( + ) of the number of wrong positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions is more representative than P ( 2 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Hence , it is natural to measure procedure quality by the sum P ( 1 ) + P ( + ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Exactly this procedure quality measure was used in [ 5 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In medical decision making ( diagnostic testing ) the terms sensitivity ( sens = 1 - P ( 1 ) ) and specificity ( spec = 1 - P ( 2 ) ) are frequently used to quantify the accuracy of a procedure , while the quantity 1 - P ( + ) is known as the positive predictive value .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Alternative terminology is discussed in [ 12 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The ROC curve plotting sens against 1 - spec is a popular way of showing the overall performance of a diagnostic test without specification of a cut off value .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Overall comparison of the statistics T ( 1 ) , eta , T ( 2 ) , T ^ ( 2 )", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Mean values of Nall ( where averaging is performed over all variants presented in Table 2 ) for different statistics are the following : 241 for eta , 310 for T ( 1 ) , 320 for T ( 2 ) , and 356 for T ^ ( 2 ) ( recall that differences in the order of 10 % can be considered to be significant ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "These numbers show that the statistics can clearly be ordered with respect to the prediction quality : the best statistic is eta , then comes T ( 1 ) , then T ( 2 ) , and finally T ^ ( 2 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "For the comparison of the statistics eta , T ( 1 ) , as well as for the comparison of statistics the T ( 2 ) , T ^ ( 2 ) this conclusion is obvious .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "For the comparison of the statistics T ( 1 ) , T ( 2 ) it seems to be less obvious , but the consideration of variants in which the calculation of coefficients ai is performed using formula ( 13 ) ( i . e . , variants [ 0 , 0 ] and [ 1 , 0 ] ; recall that the statistic T ( 1 ) has only such variants ) clearly shows that the statistic T ( 1 ) is considerably better than T ( 2 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The same conclusion can be drawn from the comparison of ROC curves presented in Fig .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "2 .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Testing results show that the prediction quality for the best variant of the statistic eta ( see the first line of Table 2 ) is much higher ( higher by 50 % ) in comparison with results of [ 5 ] ( see the line of Table 2 that corresponds to T ^ ( 2 ) [ 0 , 1 ] ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "That is the most striking finding of the current paper .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "It is interesting to see that the statistic eta turned out to be better than T ( 1 ) : the latter would be expected to be better as it equals the logarithm of the likelihood ratio ( in reality , it does not equal this logarithm because the xi i are not independent ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We suppose that this fact can be explained as follows .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Recall that T ( 1 ) and eta are equivalent for an arbitrary fixed word omega .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "These statistics turn out to be not equivalent only if they are compared on the whole totality of words .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "It is worth noting that the variation of the values of the statistic T ( 1 ) ( i . e . , the difference between values of T ( 1 ) in cases xi 1 = . . . . = xi n = 0 and xi 1 = . . . . = xi n = 1 ) significantly depends on a word omega : for some words these values vary from - 700 to 700 , for some other from - 0 . 01 to 0 . 01 .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In principle , the optimal threshold value is different for different words .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "As the ranges of T ( 1 ) values essentially vary , then it is probable that optimal thresholds also essentially vary .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The optimal threshold for the whole totality of words is a certain mean value of thresholds over individual words omega .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Since the optimal thresholds are significantly different for different words , the quality of the mean is low : for certain words ( e . g . , words with small variation of T ( 1 ) ) this mean is completely unrepresentative .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In the same time , the range of values of eta is the same for all words ( these values lie between 0 and 1 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Consequently , the difference between optimal thresholds for individual words is probably not so significant , and the mean gives better quality for individual words in comparison with T ( 1 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "From the point of view of prediction quality the statistic T ( 2 ) turned out to be worse than T ( 1 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "It is not surprising , because during the derivation of the formula for T ( 2 ) along with the incorrect assumption of independence of xi i we also made the incorrect assumption of the normal distribution of eta .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This consideration is applicable to T ^ ( 2 ) as well .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Since the cut - off points for these statistics are determined empirically in the test set and validated in the training set , the violation of the normality assumption does not invalidate the procedures as such , but might affect their performance .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Effect of procedure modifications", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The next issue is the dependence of prediction quality on procedure modifications .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "One can see that for a fixed statistic the prediction quality significantly depends on the choice of the variant .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Thus , the introduction of modifications turned out to be effective .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "It is interesting that all statistics for which coefficients aj can be calculated in different ways ( these are the statistics eta , T ( 2 ) T ^ ( 2 ) ) prediction quality was better in case when these coefficients were calculated using the iterative procedure .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "At the same time the dependence of prediction quality on the modification related to the consideration of lengths of primary local alignments is more intricate : for the statistic eta , and to a lesser extent for the statistics T ( 1 ) , T ( 2 ) , the results are better if lengths of primary local alignments are considered , but for the statistic T ^ ( 2 ) results are better when lengths of primary local alignments are not considered .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Currently reasons of this fact are not clear for us .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "As it was noted , the dependence of results on modifications dealing with the number of considered primary local alignments for similar sequences is not essential .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "As expected , q ( omega ) gave essentially worse results in comparison with T ( 1 ) , eta , T ( 2 ) , T ^ ( 2 ) ( see Table 2 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "In our application similarity is measured by the power value ( see [ 9 , 10 ] ) as used in the other statistics in this paper and mentioned before , while [ 2 ] used the E - value .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "The results were better than in the statistics q ( omega ) , but worse than in any of our statistics .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "The enormous diversity of crop diseases caused by these eukaryotic micro - organisms poses a difficult challenge to the development of durable disease control strategies .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Identifying common underlying molecular mechanisms necessary for pathogenesis in a wide range of pathogenic species is therefore a major goal of current research .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Approximately 100 , 000 species of fungi have so far been described , but only a very small proportion of these are pathogenic [ 1 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Phylogenetic studies have , meanwhile , shown that disease - causing pathogens are not necessarily closely - related to each other , and in fact are spread throughout all taxonomic groups of fungi , often showing a close evolutionary relationship to non - pathogenic species [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "It therefore seems likely that phytopathogenicity has evolved as a trait many times during fungal and oomycete evolution [ 1 ] and in some groups may be ancestral to the more recent emergence of saprotrophic species .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "A significant effort has gone into the identification of pathogenicity determinants - individual genes that are essential for a pathogen to invade a host plant successfully , but which are dispensable for saprophytic growth [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , far from being novel proteins encoded only by the genomes of pathogenic fungi , many of the genes identified so far encode components of conserved signalling pathways that are found in all species of fungi , such as the mitogen activated protein ( MAP ) kinases [ 6 ] , adenylate cyclase [ 7 ] and G - protein subunits [ 8 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The MAP kinase pathways , for example , have been studied extensively in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and trigger morphological and biochemical changes in response to external stimuli such as starvation stress or hyperosmotic conditions [ 9 ] .", "tgt": "yeast [SEP] Saccharomyces cerevisiae [EOS]"}
{"src": "In pathogenic fungi , components of these pathways have evolved instead to regulate the morphological changes associated with plant infection .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "For example , appressorium formation in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea , stimulated by hard , hydrophobic surfaces is regulated by a MAP kinase cascade [ 10 ] .", "tgt": "rice blast fungus [SEP] Magnaporthe grisea [EOS]"}
{"src": "This pathway deploys novel classes of G - protein coupled receptors not found in the genome of S . cerevisiae [ 11 ] , but the inductive signal is transmitted via a MAP kinase , Pmk1 , that is a functional homologue of the yeast Fus3 MAP kinase where it serves a role in pheromone signalling [ 10 ] .", "tgt": "S . cerevisiae [SEP] yeast [EOS]"}
{"src": "Similarly , conserved metabolic pathways such as the glyoxylate cycle and amino acid biosynthesis are also important for pathogenesis [ 12 ] - [ 14 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This may in some cases reflect the nutritional environment the pathogen encounters when growing in the host plant tissue , and in others shows the importance of simple metabolites for pathogenic processes , such as the role of glycerol as a compatible solute for generating turgor pressure in the appressorium of M . grisea [ 15 ] .", "tgt": "M . grisea [EOS]"}
{"src": "It is undoubtedly the case , however , that identification of such genes has also been a consequence of the manner in which these studies have been carried out , often using yeast as a model organism to test hypotheses concerning the developmental biology and biochemistry of plant pathogenic species .", "tgt": "yeast [EOS]"}
{"src": "Other pathogenicity factors identified to date have been shown to be involved in functions associated with host infection , such as plant cell wall degradation , toxin biosynthesis and protection against plant defences [ reviewed in 5 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Identification of a pathogenicity factor generally involves making a mutant fungal strain with a non - functioning version of the gene by targeted gene deletion and assaying the ability of the mutant to cause disease .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Therefore , most pathogenicity factors identified so far , have been validated in only a small number of genetically tractable pathogenic fungi , such as M . grisea and the corn smut Ustilago maydis and many of the advances in understanding the developmental biology of plant infection have occurred in these model pathogens [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] .", "tgt": "M . grisea [SEP] corn [SEP] Ustilago maydis [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , there are severe limitations to studying pathogenicity by mutating one gene at a time and working predominantly with a hypothesis - driven , reverse genetics approach .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Many virulence - associated processes , for instance , such as the development of infection structures and haustoria , are likely to involve a large number of gene products and so there is likely to be redundancy in gene function .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "One example of this is cutinase , a type of methyl esterase that hydrolyses the protective cutin layer present on the outside of the plant epidermis .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Cutinase was excluded as a pathogencity factor for M . grisea on the basis that a mutant strain containing a non - functional cutinase - encoding gene was still able to cause rice blast disease [ 18 ] .", "tgt": "M . grisea [SEP] rice [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , sequencing of the M . grisea genome has shown the presence of eight potential cutinase - encoding genes implicated in virulence [ 19 ] .", "tgt": "M . grisea [EOS]"}
{"src": "Additionally , targeted gene deletion is not feasible in many important pathogens and the normal definition of fungal pathogenicity cannot be applied in the case of obligate biotrophs , such as the powdery mildew fungus Blumeria graminis , which cannot be cultured away from living host plants .", "tgt": "Blumeria graminis [EOS]"}
{"src": "Therefore , new approaches are needed to identify genes that are vital for the process of pathogenicity .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "These include high - throughput methods such as microarray analysis , serial analysis of gene expression ( SAGE ) , insertional mutagenesis , proteomics and metabolomics [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] and are dependent on the availability of genome sequence information .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "After the initial release of the genome of the budding yeast S . cerevisiae in 1996 [ 21 ] , the number of publicly available sequenced fungal genomes has recently risen very quickly .", "tgt": "yeast [SEP] S . cerevisiae [EOS]"}
{"src": "A large number of fungal genome sequences are now publicly available , including those from several phytopathogenic fungi , including M . grisea [ 22 ] , Ustilago maydis [ 23 ] , Gibberella zeae [ 24 ] ( the causal agent of head blight of wheat and barley ) , Stagonospora nodorum [ 25 ] ( the causal agent of glume blotch of wheat ) , the grey mould fungus Botrytis cinerea and the white mould fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum [ reviewed in 19 ] .", "tgt": "M . grisea [SEP] Ustilago maydis [SEP] Gibberella zeae [SEP] wheat [SEP] barley [SEP] Stagonospora nodorum [SEP] wheat [SEP] Botrytis cinerea [SEP] Sclerotinia sclerotiorum [EOS]"}

{"src": "In order to compare such a large number of genomes , an object - oriented data warehouse has been constructed known as e - Fungi [ 26 ] which integrates genomic data with a variety of functional data and has a powerful set of queries that enables sophisticated , whole - genome comparisons to be performed .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "To compare genome inventories , the entire set of predicted proteins from the 36 species ( 348 , 787 proteins ) were clustered using Markov Chain Clustering [ 27 ] as described previously [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "A total of 165 clusters contained proteins from all 36 species used in this study ( Table S1 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Not surprisingly , they included many proteins involved in basic cellular processes , such as ribosomal proteins , components of transcription , translation and DNA replication apparatus , cytoskeletal proteins , histones , proteins involved in the secretory pathway , protein folding , protein sorting and ubiquitin - mediated proteolysis and enzymes involved in primary metabolism .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Only 16 clusters contained proteins that were found in all 34 species of fungi , but which were absent from the two species of oomycete ( Table S2 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This number of fungal - specific clusters is surprisingly low considering the phylogenetic distance between the oomycetes and fungi [ 30 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The list however , is consistent with the fundamental differences in biology between fungi and oomycetes and included proteins involved in fungal septation , glycosylation , transcriptional regulation , cell signalling , as well as two amino - acyl tRNA synthetases .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The obligate mammalian pathogen Encephalitozoon cuniculi , a microsporidian fungus , has a reduced genome that codes only for 1 , 997 proteins and lacks genes encoding enzymes of many primary metabolic pathways such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle , fatty acid beta - oxidation , biosynthetic enzymes of the vast majority of amino acids , fatty acids and nucleotides , as well as components of the respiratory electron transport chain and F1 - F0 ATP synthase .", "tgt": "Encephalitozoon cuniculi [EOS]"}
{"src": "It also lacks mitochondria and peroxisomes [ 31 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Therefore , we reasoned that the inclusion of this species in the analysis of MCL clusters is likely to result in underestimation of the number of groups of conserved proteins .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "By discarding E . cuniculi , there are 377 clusters that contained proteins from 35 species of fungi and oomycetes ( Table S3 ) .", "tgt": "E . cuniculi [EOS]"}
{"src": "This relatively small number of fungal - conserved clusters reflects the large evolutionary distance between members of the fungal kingdom , as well as complex patterns of gene gains and losses during the evolution of fungi .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Basidiomycetes and ascomycetes are thought to have diverged nearly 1 , 000 million years ago [ 32 ] and the Saccharomycotina alone are more evolutionarily diverged than the Chordate phylum of the animal kingdom [ 33 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Since the divergence of Saccharomycotina ( hemiascomycetes ) and Pezizomycotina ( euascomycetes ) , the genomes of the latter have greatly increased in size , partly due to the appearance of novel genes related to the filamentous lifestyle .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Lineage - specific gene losses have also been shown in a number of hemiascomycete species [ 34 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "As well as the groups of proteins mentioned above ( Table S1 ) , the fungal - conserved clusters included those containing enzymes from primary metabolic pathways not present in E . cuniculi , such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle , amino acid metabolism , fatty acid biosynthesis , cholesterol biosynthesis and nucleotide metabolism , as well as components of the respiratory electron transport chain and F1 - F0 ATP synthase .", "tgt": "E . cuniculi [EOS]"}
{"src": "The conserved protein clusters also include a number of transporters ( including mitochondrial transporters ) , enzymes involved in haem biosynthesis , autophagy - related proteins , those involved in protein targeting to the peroxisome and vacuole and additional groups of proteins involved in signal transduction that are not present in E . cuniculi ( including those involved in inosine triphosphate and leukotriene metabolism ) .", "tgt": "E . cuniculi [EOS]"}

{"src": "As well as those mentioned previously ( Table S2 ) , the group includes a number of clusters of transporters that are conserved in fungi but not found in oomycetes , as well as proteins involved in fungal cell wall synthesis , and lipid metabolism .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "It may be the case that the genomes of oomycete species do not possess orthologues of the fungal genes in these clusters , or alternatively , the large evolutionary distance between the oomycetes and fungi mean that the corresponding orthologues from each Kingdom cluster separately .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Generally the genomes of the filamentous fungi contain more protein - encoding genes ( 9 , 000 - 17 , 000 ) than those from unicellular yeasts ( 5 , 000 - 7 , 000 ) , perhaps reflecting their greater morphological complexity and secondary metabolic capacity .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Discussion", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Results of the present study demonstrate the delayed emergence of neurobehavioral toxicity due to perinatal MeHg exposure , which presumably developed after brain MeHg concentrations had leveled off .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This emergent toxicity was exaggerated in MT - null mice and was more distinct in females .", "tgt": "mice [EOS]"}
{"src": "To our knowledge , our findings show the first clear - cut demonstrations of a long latency period of MeHg neurobehavioral toxicity in rodents and possible genetic susceptibility for the emergent toxicity .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The exposure level should be considered before discussing the end points .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "On PND10 , immediately after the cessation of MeHg exposure , the brain Hg concentration was approximately 0 . 5 mu g / g , regardless of the strain or sex .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In a previous study , the brain Hg concentration in mice perinatally exposed to 6 mg MeHg / L ( via water ) peaked between PND0 and PND4 and was approximately three times higher than on PND21 ( Goulet et al . 2003 ) .", "tgt": "mice [EOS]"}
{"src": "Therefore , the peak brain Hg concentration , which is presumably observed around birth , can be estimated as about 3 - fold higher than that on PND10 and would be approximately 1 . 5 mu g / g ( 0 . 5 mu g / g x 3 ) , which is one of the lowest levels among recent rodent studies .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "As shown by Sakamoto et al .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "It should be noted that rats have different Hg kinetics ( Hirayama and Yasutake 1986 ; Yasutake and Hirayama 1990 ) due to the high affinity of rat hemoglobin for MeHg ( Clarkson and Magos 2006 ) .", "tgt": "rats [EOS]"}
{"src": "The most important observation of the present study was that the effects of low - level MeHg exposure were detected only at later stages in the lives of the mice .", "tgt": "mice [EOS]"}
{"src": "Except for the central - area occupancy in OPF in MT - null females , no statistically significant effects of MeHg were observed in any of the three behavioral tests at 12 weeks of age .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In contrast , significant effects were observed in all three tests at 52 weeks of age .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The brain Hg concentration of the exposed groups had leveled off and was not distinguishable from the non - exposed group at 13 weeks of age , immediately after the first phase of the behavioral testing .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Therefore , in the present study , there was a latency period in which the dose and effects could not be detected , although effects were observed 9 months later .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Another notable observation was that the emergent manifestation of toxicity was also recognized in the suppression of body weight ( except for wild - type females ) , which only became apparent on or after 28 weeks of age .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The existence of a latency period of as long as several years after chronic ( 7 years from birth ) , low - level exposure to MeHg has been described in nonhuman primates ( Rice 1996 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In that case , however , the Hg concentration in the brain remained elevated , presumably as a result of the long exposure .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Indeed , Rice ( 1996 ) argued that the minute amount of residual brain Hg could have caused the delayed toxicity .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This was clearly not the case in the present study because the Hg concentration leveled off around the time of the first phase of the behavioral study .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The absence of behavioral effects at 12 weeks of age ruled out the possibility that the residual behavioral effects were due to elevated Hg early in life .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Therefore , the behavioral toxicity that surfaced at 52 weeks of age must have had its origin before the brain Hg concentration leveled off ( at or before 13 weeks of age ) , although the redistribution of Hg to the brain from other sites of deposition , such as the liver , cannot be completely excluded .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The long silent period before the manifestations of toxicity emerged suggests that a slow process plays a role in this latent toxicity .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Although an example of a slow process is aging , 52 weeks of age might not be sufficiently old for a mouse to be considered aged in the physiologic sense because C57BL / 6 mice have a relatively long life span among mouse strains [ median survival of 27 - 31 months ( Gower and Lamberty 1993 ) ] and a survival rate at 18 - 19 months as high as 90 % ( Institute on Aging HP ) ( National Institute on Aging 2008 ) .", "tgt": "mouse [SEP] mice [SEP] mouse [EOS]"}

{"src": "The observed effects of MeHg , including the deterioration in the PA and MM and suppression in the OPF ( in wild - type mice ) , were consistent with these reported effects of aging on behavioral function ( in the sense described above ) , except for the increased OPF activity in the MT - null mice .", "tgt": "mice [SEP] mice [EOS]"}
{"src": "Regardless of its neural basis , the basis of neurobehavioral toxicity should be sought in early life stages when the brain Hg concentration is highly elevated ( approximately 1 . 5 mu g / g at its peak ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Some in vivo experiments have demonstrated several candidate mechanisms of perinatal exposure to MeHg , including abnormal migration of neurons and / or glias ( Kakita et al . 2003 ; Rodier et al . 1984 ) , but at higher Hg concentrations .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Using exactly the same exposure protocol as the present study , we found suppressed activity of type III iodo - thyronine deiodinase , a thyroid hormone - metabolizing enzyme , in the brains of PND10 mouse neonates ( Mori et al . 2006 ) , consistent with our previous study of higher MeHg doses ( Watanabe et al . 1999 ) .", "tgt": "mouse [EOS]"}
{"src": "This perturbation could be one of the candidate mechanisms responsible for the later anomalous behaviors because even a transient change in thyroid hormones during the critical period of perinatal life exerts long - term consequences ( Auso et al . 2004 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The effects of MeHg at 52 weeks of age were influenced by two potential modifying factors , sex and strain .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In the OPF , while the locomotion was affected in both strains ( although the direction was opposite ) , center occupancy was significantly increased only in the MT - null mice .", "tgt": "mice [EOS]"}

{"src": "In addition , body weight gain was suppressed in both male and female MT - null mice , whereas in wild - type mice the suppression was observed only in males .", "tgt": "mice [SEP] mice [EOS]"}
{"src": "Taken together , the MT - null strain appeared to be slightly more susceptible to the late - emergent effects of MeHg .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Several lines of evidence have shown that MT - I , II is protective against the toxicity of MeHg ( Leiva - Presa et al . 2004 ; Yao et al . 2000 ) , and the present results were basically consistent with these reports .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We have also reported the susceptibility of the MT - null strain to the neurotoxic effects of metallic Hg ( Yoshida et al . 2004 , 2006 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The difference in the susceptibility to MeHg between sexes is still debated ( Clarkson and Magos 2006 ; National Research Council 2000 ; Vahter 2007 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In the present study , some responses to MeHg were different between the sexes , including OPF performance at 12 and 52 weeks of age and MM performance at 52 weeks .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The fact that the MT - null female group was the only group affected by MeHg at 12 weeks may suggest the particular susceptibility of females in this strain .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This point needs to be clarified in further experiments .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The question remains of why MT - null mice are susceptible to the delayed neurotoxicity of perinatal MeHg .", "tgt": "mice [EOS]"}
{"src": "Apparently kinetics play only a minor role because the strain did not show distinct effects on the brain Hg concentration at PND10 .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The significantly lower brain Hg concentration in MT - null mice compared with corresponding wild - type mice at 13 weeks of age indicated that MT - I , II might play a significant role in the retention of Hg ( or MeHg ) .", "tgt": "mice [SEP] mice [EOS]"}
{"src": "This is consistent with the results of studies of metallic Hg exposure ( Yoshida et al . 2004 , 2005 ) ; a lower brain Hg concentration may not guarantee lower toxicity , supporting the protective role of the protein .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Earlier studies suggest that brain MT - I , II has an important role both in the response to oxidative injury ( Potter et al . 2007 ) and in the process of aging ( Kojima et al . 1999 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Therefore , the lack of MT can exaggerate the toxicity of MeHg by enhancing the initial effects due to oxygen radicals and / or by accelerating functional aging .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Apart from this , an intriguing possibility is that the brain - specific isoform , MT - III , might contribute to the results we obtained because the expression of MT - III , together with MT - I , is increased in the brain of old rats , resulting in the low availability of free zinc for synapses ( Mocchegiani et al . 2004 ) .", "tgt": "rats [EOS]"}
{"src": "The age - dependent expressions of MT isoforms might be modified in MT - null mice .", "tgt": "mice [EOS]"}
{"src": "Results of the present study might allow the possibility of alternative interpretations due to some potentially confounding factors .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "For example , except for the wild - type females , we observed significant differences in body weight between MeHg - exposed and non - exposed groups .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Because these differences only became clear later in life , they might be associated with the toxicity that also emerged later in life .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Manipulation of body weight in rodents alters activity levels , although the reported results are not always consistent with each other ( Harrison and Archer 1987 ; Samuelsson et al . 2008 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Also , the differential performance in PA could be related with the potential effects of MeHg on ( electric ) shock sensitivity , which we did not examine .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "At least one high - dose study with adult rats showed reduced electric sensitivity due to mercury exposure ( Wu et al . 1985 ) .", "tgt": "rats [EOS]"}
{"src": "These possibilities need to be addressed in future studies .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "It has been reported previously that treatment with iAs enhances the production and translocation of NRF2 into the nucleus in several cell types .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , until now it has remained uncertain whether the induction of NRF2 by iAs mediates the transcriptional activation of the K16 gene in keratinocytes .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In our current experiments , we demonstrated that iAs elongates the half - life of the NRF2 protein , which results in its increased expression levels .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Furthermore , this iAs - induced NRF2 protein was shown to bind to the ARE sequences in the promoter region of the K16 gene .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Finally , by overexpressing NRF2 , we have clarified that its induction is involved in not only the gene expression of the detoxification gene TXN , but also in the upregulation of K16 expression in HaCaT cells through the ARE in the K16 gene promoter .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "These experiments indicate an important and novel function for NRF2 in the regulation of K16 in keratinocytes and also help to further explain the molecular mechanisms underlying arsenic - mediated epidermal hyperkeratosis .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In our present experiments , the expression levels of K16 mRNA and protein were indeed found to be enhanced by iAs in a dose - dependent manner ( Figure 1 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In addition , luciferase assays of the K16 promoter revealed that iAs enhances its activity in a dose - dependent fashion , which is stimulated by AP - 1 - like sites and an ARE ( Figure 2 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The promoter of the human K16 gene was recently cloned and sequenced , and several AP - 1 - like sites were found within the - 515 - bp region of the gene ( Wang and Chang 2003 ) .", "tgt": "human [EOS]"}

{"src": "It has been well documented that the ARE core sequence includes an AP - 1 - like binding site ( TGAC / GTCA ) , followed by a GC box ( Rushmore et al . 1991 ; Xie et al . 1995 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We have found in our current analyses that the AP - 1 - like site within the K16 promoter region from - 148 to - 140 bp ( 5 ' - GGAGTCAGC - 3 ' ) resembles a consensus ARE sequence .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Gel shifts with an K16Mut - ARE probe ( harboring a mutation in the ARE GC box ) clearly show that the ARE sequence in the K16 promoter , particularly the terminal GC dinucleotide , is essential for mediating iAs - induced K16 transactivation and NRF2 binding ( Figure 4F ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Several investigations have suggested that the GC nucleotides within the ARE are essential for both the basal and oxidative stress - induced activities of the ARE - related genes , NAD ( P ) H dehydrogenase quinone 1 ( NQO1 ) and glutamate - cysteine ligase catalytic subunit ( GCLC ) ( Wasserman and Fahl 1997 ; Wild et al . 1998 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Our current results are consistent with these earlier studies in showing that the formation of the iAs - responsive NRF2 / ARE complexes is reduced by a mutation in the GC box .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Collectively , our present observations reveal a new molecular mechanism in which iAs - induced K16 gene expression is also regulated by activation NRF2 / ARE pathways .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "It has been widely accepted that oxidative stress disrupts sequestration of NRF2 by KEAP1 , permits NRF2 translocation to the nucleus , and transactivates the expression of various NRF2 - mediated genes ( Dinkova - Kostova et al . 2002 ; McMahon et al . 2003 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Our present study showed that iAs elongates the half - life of the NRF2 protein but has no effects upon KEAP1 expression ( Figure 5 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Several earlier reports also indicated that either oxidative stress or antioxidant substances stabilize the expression of the NRF2 protein , either by directly modifying the cysteine residues on KEAP1 to disrupt the NRF2 / KEAP1 complex ( Dinkova - Kostova et al . 2002 ) or by facilitating the release of NRF2 through the phosphorylation of the NRF2 / KEAP1 complex ( Bloom and Jaiswal 2003 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "In addition , the promoter of the K6 gene bears a remarkable sequence similarity to the K16 promoter ( Jiang et al . 1993 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Therefore , we examined whether K16 gene expression is also regulated by NRF2 .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In the present study , the gene expression and transactivation of K16 were dramatically induced by transfection with WT - NRF2 via in HaCaT cells , clearly demonstrating that NRF2 acts as a direct transcriptional regulator of the K16 gene ( Figure 6 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In addition , we also showed that transfection of HaCaT cells with WT - NRF2 induces the expression of detoxification gene TXN ( Figure 6A ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "NRF2 may thus have a major role to play in the development of hyperkeratosis , whereas the expression and induction of NRF2 is implicated in cell protection against a variety of genotoxic and cytotoxic effects .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Background", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Co - occurrence analysis is a technique often applied in text mining , comparative genomics , and promoter analysis .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The methodologies and statistical models used to evaluate the significance of association between co - occurring entities are quite diverse , however .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Methodology / Principal Findings", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We present a general framework for co - occurrence analysis based on a bipartite graph representation of the data , a novel co - occurrence statistic , and software performing co - occurrence analysis as well as generation and analysis of co - occurrence networks .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We show that the overall stringency of co - occurrence analysis depends critically on the choice of the null - model used to evaluate the significance of co - occurrence and find that random sampling from a complete permutation set of the bipartite graph permits co - occurrence analysis with optimal stringency .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We show that the Poisson - binomial distribution is the most natural co - occurrence probability distribution when vertex degrees of the bipartite graph are variable , which is usually the case .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Calculation of Poisson - binomial P - values is difficult , however .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Therefore , we propose a fast bi - binomial approximation for calculation of P - values and show that this statistic is superior to other measures of association such as the Jaccard coefficient and the uncertainty coefficient .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Introduction", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Biological research has experienced a paradigm shift in the last decade catalyzed by the availability of genome sequences and the resulting development of high - throughput technologies .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The large data volumes produced by these novel technologies are often published as supplementary material and / or stored in extensive data repositories [ 1 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Functional interpretation of these data is an ongoing challenge .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Co - occurrence analysis , based on the hypothesis that co - occurring entities are functionally linked , is a technique that has been used in three main areas of biological research :", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Co - occurrence of genes in sequenced genomes relies on the fact that proteins do not function in isolation and are dependent on other proteins , either as direct binding partners , or as catalysts of substrates .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Thus , when two proteins significantly co - occur in a large number of genomes or can be observed as fusion proteins in a subset of genomes , they are likely to be binding partners or enzymes needed for a specific metabolic pathway .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Examples of those studies have been reported by [ 2 ] - [ 7 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Text mining is a quickly evolving field that aims at developing technologies helping to cope with the functional interpretation of large volumes of publications .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Co - occurrence of gene names in publication abstracts , entire publications , or other gene - related databases has been used to derive co - occurrence networks with clear evidence that edges in those networks are reflecting functionally relevant relationships [ 8 ] - [ 11 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Gene names have also been analyzed for co - occurrence with other entities such as mutations [ 12 ] , chemical compounds [ 13 ] , and disease related keywords [ 14 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "From the resulting networks , hypotheses about candidate genes involved in inherited diseases and drug targets can be derived .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Clustering of gene related publications using keywords has been applied to enhance the quality of gene expression clusters [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "More general ( non gene - centric ) approaches try to organize the literature into functional areas based on co - occurrence of MeSH terms , keywords , diseases , phenotypes , chemicals , and similar objects of biomedical research interest [ 17 ] - [ 21 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Co - occurrence analysis of transcription factor binding motifs has been carried out in a variety of slightly differing ways in a wide range of organisms , including humans .", "tgt": "humans [EOS]"}
{"src": "[ 22 ] - [ 33 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The underlying hypothesis is that co - regulated genes , identified usually by gene expression studies , should contain specific combinations of transcription factor binding motifs in their upstream regulatory regions , the identification of which would allow the reverse - engineering of transcription regulatory networks [ 34 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We have recently applied co - occurrence analysis to studying published gene expression signatures and showed that co - occurrence patterns of genes reflect cancer signaling pathways [ 35 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Although co - occurrence analysis has a respectable history , the methodologies used in the studies mentioned above could not be easily applied to studying gene expression signatures .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "There are three main reasons that dictated the use of a different approach .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "First , gene expression signatures can vary in size by orders of magnitude .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Obviously , the larger a signature the more likely it is to find two or more genes co - occurring in that signature .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Thus , the significance of co - occurrences must be evaluated in the presence of considerable heterogeneity of co - occurrence probabilities among gene lists .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "As a consequence , the statistics used to evaluate the significance of co - occurrence events must reflect this heterogeneity .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In particular , it must be based on list - specific co - occurrence probabilities .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Second , in the vast majority of previous studies , co - occurrence is analyzed for pair - wise combinations of co - occurring entities .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We found that the resulting stringency of this approach is not adequate for the analysis of published gene expression signatures [ 35 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Third , the null - model against which the significance of co - occurrences is tested does not work well for gene expression signatures .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "A common procedure is to use generic randomization of the entire data set under analysis or to select subsets of data entries randomly for comparison purposes .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , gene expression signatures are composed of distinct gene sets and the null - model must maintain this property , which is not guaranteed using these approaches .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Furthermore , the list - specific nature of co - occurrence probabilities cannot be dealt with properly .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "NetCutter was developed to address these challenges and to provide a generic tool for generating and analyzing co - occurrence networks .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Although NetCutter has been developed for the analysis of gene expression signatures , it is based on abstract concepts that make it applicable to a wide variety of problems .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The input is represented by a bipartite graph that is composed of list - entry pairs , which are stored in tab - separated text format .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Co - occurrence of entries in lists is analyzed using pair - wise or higher order combinations of entries .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The significance of co - occurrence is tested using a novel bi - binomial approximation of Poisson - binomial statistics ( which is a binomial distribution with trial specific probabilities ) that handles list - length - heterogeneity properly and provides a novel measure of association that is found to be superior to the Jaccard and the uncertainty coefficients .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Occurrence probabilities are obtained from an edge - swapping procedure that maintains vertex degrees in the underlying bipartite graph and distinct sets of entries per list .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "As we shall see below , this procedure has a number of advantages over other possible null - models and permits co - occurrence analysis with near maximum stringency .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Last but not least , NetCutter is equipped with a number of algorithms for the identification of network communities , vertex ranking , and convenience tools needed in the analysis of co - occurrence networks , or any undirected graph .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We illustrate the utility of NetCutter in the identification of corresponding clusters of genes and publications from the PubLiME data set .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Reversing the list - entry order in the bipartite graph permits identifying communities of entries as well as communities of lists .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We show that communities of publications corresponding to communities of genes in the PubLiME data set can be used to generate hypotheses about the putative function of gene communities .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "The bipartite graph model of co - occurrence analysis", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Co - occurrence analysis using NetCutter is based on the abstraction of list - entry pairs .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Any entity that co - occurs with some other entity must be confined to some sort of container where co - occurrence is observed .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "For example , in the case of gene name co - occurrence in PubMed abstracts , the abstract is the container and the gene names are the co - occurring entities .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Similarly , co - occurrence of transcription factor binding motifs is observed in gene promoters .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The promoters are the containers where motif entities co - occur .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The containers generally host more than one entity ( otherwise co - occurrence would be impossible ) and can be conveniently interpreted as lists .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The co - occurring entities are the list entries .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Lists and entries form a bipartite graph with one part of the graph representing lists and the other part representing entries .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The presence of a given entry in a given list is indicated by an edge between the corresponding list and entry vertices .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "It is required that each entry can be linked to the same list only once .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Without loss of generality , let ' s consider genes as entries and PubMedID _ listIDs as lists in the following , unless otherwise specified ( Fig . 1A ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This interpretation of lists and entries has been applied in the co - occurrence analysis of published gene expression signatures [ 35 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Occurrence probabilities and null - models", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "A prerequisite for co - occurrence analysis is the availability of occurrence probabilities of genes per list .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The occurrence probabilities can be derived from randomizing the bipartite graph and are dependent on the choice of the null - model .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "A null - model creates an occurrence probability matrix where the occurrence probability for each list - gene pair is listed .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "As a general property of this matrix , the sum of all matrix elements must equal the number of edges in the bipartite graph .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This is because each edge is linked to either side of the bipartite graph with certainty and therefore the sum of occurrence probabilities over all lists ( which can be calculated as the row sum if genes are listed vertically or as the column sum if genes are listed horizontally ) followed by summing the results over all genes must be 1 for every edge .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The number of matrix elements is given by # genes * # lists and therefore the average occurrence probability for any null - model must be # edges / ( # genes * # lists ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "As a consequence , different null - models will only be distinguished by the way they attribute occurrence probabilities to vertices with different vertex degrees but not by the average occurrence probability .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We consider six different strategies to randomize the bipartite graph .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "First , we could reconnect all edges of the graph randomly .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The probability of being connected by an edge for a given list - gene pair is given by ( 1 / # genes ) * ( 1 / # lists ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Since there are # edges edges to be reconnected , the occurrence probability for a single list - gene pair is # edges / ( # genes * # lists ) , i . e . equal to the average occurrence probability .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Thus , this model provides equal occurrence probabilities for all gene - list pairs and does not consider vertex degrees .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We call this model the generic randomization ( GR ) model in the following .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Second , we could disconnect the edges on only the list side of the bipartite graph and reconnect them randomly .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The occurrence probability of a gene vertex would be given by ( gene vertex degree ) / # lists .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The sum of these probabilities over all lists is equal to the gene vertex degree and the sum of all gene vertex degrees is equal to the total number of edges .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Thus , the sum of all matrix elements is equal to the number of edges , as required .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Since this model considers gene vertex degrees , we call it the gene vertex degree ( GVD ) model .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Third , we disconnect the edges on the gene side of the bipartite graph and reconnect them randomly .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The probability of a list vertex being connected to a gene would be given by ( list vertex degree ) / # genes .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The sum of these probabilities over all genes is equal to the list vertex degree and the sum of all list vertex degrees is equal to the total number of edges .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Again , the sum of all matrix elements is equal to the total number of edges .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Since this model considers list vertex degrees , we call it the list vertex degree ( LVD ) model .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In model four and five , we reconnect edges considering both gene and list vertex degrees and allow multiple edges between list - gene pairs .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The occurrence probabilities in model four are calculated according to the binomial distribution .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We calculate the probability of a list - gene pair for being connected as the cumulative binomial probability of the list - gene pair being chosen at least once in the process of randomly reconnecting the edges .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This can be achieved by setting the number of trials equal to the gene vertex degree , the probability of success equal to the list vertex degree divided by the total number of edges , and the number of successes equal to 0 .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The occurrence probability of a list - gene pair is then given by the complement of this probability .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This model is called the binomial ( BN ) model .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In model five , we calculate occurrence probabilities according to the hypergeometric distribution .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The number of successes in the sample is equal to 0 , the sample size is equal to the gene vertex degree , the number of successes in the population is set to the list vertex degree , and the population size is the total number of edges .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Again , the occurrence probability of a list - gene pair is obtained as the complement of this probability .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We call this model the hypergeometric ( HG ) model .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Calculating occurrence probabilities in this manner does not guarantee that the matrix elements add up to the total number of edges .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Therefore , the matrices are normalized such that this condition is satisfied by multiplying each matrix element with the factor # edges / ( observed matrix sum ) , which is generally quite close to 1 , however .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In model six , we again consider vertex degrees , but we require that each list is composed of distinct sets of genes .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Thus , multiple edges are forbidden .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This condition is satisfied by applying an edge - swapping procedure during graph randomization .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Edge - swapping works by randomly choosing two list - gene pairs from the bipartite graph and prior to performing the edge - swap , a test is performed to ensure that the two genes are not already linked to the respective target lists .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This procedure is performed a large number of times .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "To ensure complete randomization of the graph , the number of swaps performed should be significantly larger than the number of edges .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "After performing R randomizations of the graph and counting the number of times a gene has been linked to a particular list , division of this number by R gives the occurrence probability of a gene in a given list .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "As will be shown below , edge - swapping produces occurrence probabilities that closely approximate occurrence probabilities obtained by generating a complete permutation set of the bipartite graph , counting the number of times a gene is found part of a list , and dividing this number by the total number of permutations .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In the permutation model , the sum of occurrence probabilities of a gene over all lists equals the gene vertex degree ( see below ) and thus the sum of all matrix elements is the number of edges .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Since permutation sets of bipartite graphs are difficult to calculate , we use the edge - swapping procedure as a close approximation and call this model the edge - swapping ( ES ) model .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "1 shows the occurrence probabilities of the different null - models for the bipartite graph shown in Fig .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "1A .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The GR model yields identical occurrence probabilities for all list - gene pairs , which is equal to the average occurrence probability in all models .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In the other models , the occurrence probabilities deviate to varying extent from the average occurrence probability as a function of vertex degrees .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In the GVD model , the deviations are a function of gene vertex degree and in the LVD model the deviations are dependent on list vertex degrees .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In the remaining models , the deviations are functions of both the gene and the list vertex degrees .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In all cases , larger than average occurrence probabilities are obtained for larger vertex degrees at the expense of smaller than average occurrence probabilities for smaller vertex degrees .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "From these data , it is difficult to choose the most effective null - model .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "A hint can be gleaned from gene1 , however .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Gene1 is present in all lists .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Therefore , the co - occurrence probability of gene1 with other genes , which is calculated by multiplying the occurrence probabilities of gene1 and geneX for every list under study , should depend only on the occurrence probability of this other gene .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In other words , the occurrence probability of gene1 in all lists should be 1 . 0 .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Only two models satisfy this constraint : The GVD and the ES models .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Since the GVD model does not consider list vertex degrees , it seems that the ES model is the preferred null - model .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Expected number of co - occurrences", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Larger lists will give rise to more co - occurrences and the number increases quickly with list vertex degree .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The dependency of the expected number of co - occurrences on the gene vertex degree is less obvious and depends strongly on the null - model .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "The null - model permits calculating the probability to find this gene in a given list .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Thus , the expected number of co - occurrences of a gene is given by the sum of expected co - occurrences in all lists where for a single list the expected co - occurrences are given by ( Nl - 1 ) * pl .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "The results are shown in Fig 2A .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The expected number of co - occurrences was calculated for all genes in all lists using all null - models and the sum of expected co - occurrences per gene is shown as a scatter plot with the gene vertex degree on the x - axis and the expected number of co - occurrences on the y - axis .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "The results are also in line with the intuitive expectation that genes with higher vertex degree give rise to more co - occurrences .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , it can be seen that this is not true for all null - models .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In particular , it is not true for the GR and the LVD models , which do not consider gene vertex degrees .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "As outlined above , it is expected that the null - model that yields the highest estimates of expected co - occurrences should permit co - occurrence analysis with the highest stringency .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "2B , this hypothesis is tested directly again using the PubLiME data set [ 35 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "For all null - models , co - occurrence analysis was carried out using module size 3 and support 5 ( co - occurrence modules must be present in at least five publications ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "More details on the probability distribution will be provided below .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The GR and GVD models perform very poorly and identify large numbers of modules with high Z - scores .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The LVD model performs a little better and approximates the BN and HG models at higher Z - score cut - offs .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The BN and HG models give essentially identical results .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , the ES model is the model that yields the fewest number of significant co - occurrence modules and is thus the most stringent .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The increased stringency of the ES model over the BN and HG models is also reflected in a higher signal - to - noise ratio calculated as the number of significant co - occurrence modules in the real bipartite graph divided by the number of modules found in a randomized bipartite graph ( Fig . 2C ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The reason for the superior stringency of the ES model over all other models can be explained by examining the average occurrence probability per gene and list vertex degree .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Fig .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "2D and E show the average occurrence probability of genes with the same gene vertex degree as a function of the gene vertex degree .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "It can be seen that the ES model yields higher occurrence probability estimates for genes with higher vertex degrees as compared to the BN and HG models .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In GR and LVD models , gene vertex degrees are ignored and occurrence probabilities for genes with large vertex degree are very small , which is compensated by larger occurrence probabilities for genes with small vertex degree .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The GVD model is identical to the ES model in this setting .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Fig .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "2E shows the average occurrence probability of all lists with the same vertex degree as a function of list vertex degree .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "It can be seen that the ES model provides higher occurrence probability estimates for large lists as compared to the BN and HG models .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In this setting , the LVD model performs like the ES model while the GR and GVD models yield small occurrence probabilities for large lists .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Since it has been shown above that long lists and genes with high vertex degree are responsible for a large part of the total number of co - occurrences for the most stringent null - models , the null - model that provides larger occurrence probability estimates for genes and lists with high vertex degree at the expense of lower estimates for smaller degrees will be the most stringent because large occurrence probabilities make co - occurrence more likely and thus less significant .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "By these criteria , the ES model is the most stringent of all models tested .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The ES model as an approximation of the permutation null - model", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The data shown above have revealed that the ES model is the best of the models tested .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "One may wonder , however , whether yet more effective null - models can be found .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "An obvious choice would be the permutation model .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In the permutation model , a complete permutation set of the bipartite graph is created such that each list is composed of distinct sets of genes .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The number of graphs where a gene is present in a given list divided by the total number of permutations then provides the occurrence probability estimate .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The permutation model is the ideal null - model because it is exhaustive .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The problem is that a complete permutation set of bipartite graphs of some complexity is very time consuming to calculate .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "For example , the simple bipartite graph from Fig .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "1A is part of a permutation set of 455 graphs .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The number of permutations is increasing quickly as the numbers of genes and lists grow .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , since edge - swapping ensures that gene lists are composed of distinct sets of genes , each edge - swap produces a graph that is part of the permutation set of the bipartite graph .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Edge - swapping can thus be viewed as a random sampling procedure from the permutation set of the bipartite graph .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Therefore , occurrence probability estimates derived by edge - swapping should approximate those obtained from the permutation model .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We generated a complete permutation set of the graph shown in Fig .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "1A to verify this hypothesis .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The results are shown in Fig .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Fig .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "3A shows how the number of possible permutations can be calculated .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Gene1 is present in all lists and does not have an impact on the total number of permutations .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Gene2 , having vertex degree two , is present in two out of three lists in one out of three possible ways .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The remaining genes have vertex degree 1 and can be freely chosen to fill the empty slots .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We can now count exactly how many times a gene is linked to a list and divide these counts by 455 , the size of the permutation set , to obtain exact occurrence probabilities .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "These numbers are shown in graphical form in Fig .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "3B and in numerical form in Fig .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "3C .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Fig .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "3B also shows the occurrence probability estimates obtained by edge - swapping side - by - side to the exact occurrence probabilities .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The graph in Fig .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "1A was subjected to edge - swapping 1000 times and the number of times a gene was found present in a list was divided by 1000 to obtain the occurrence probability .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "At each run , 100 random edge swaps were performed to ensure complete randomization of the graph .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This procedure was repeated 10 times and the mean and standard deviation of occurrence probability estimates for each gene in each list are shown .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In all cases , the mean differs from the real probability by less than two standard deviations , in most cases by less than one standard deviation .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Thus , edge - swapping provides reliable estimates of exact occurrence probabilities as determined from a complete permutation set .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "As an interesting observation , we provide evidence that occurrence probabilities are non - linear functions of vertex degrees in the edge - swapping model .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This is illustrated in Fig .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "3C .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Individual and average occurrence probabilities are shown as a function of gene and list vertex degrees .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Non - linearity of individual occurrence probabilities can be verified from the counts table underneath the plots .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , the average occurrence probability is found to depend on vertex degrees in a linear fashion instead .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This is a consequence of the fact that occurrence probabilities of a gene over all lists add up to the gene vertex degree and that the occurrence probabilities of all genes for a given list add up to the list vertex degree .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "At the same time , since the most stringent permutation based null - model predicts non - linear dependencies of individual occurrence probabilities on vertex degrees , assuming such linearity in statistical models of co - occurrence will be linked to loss of stringency .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We conclude that the ES null - model is the null - model that permits co - occurrence analysis with the highest stringency among the models tested and that it closely approximates occurrence probabilities derived from an ideal permutation model .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The increased stringency of the ES model over other models is a consequence of higher occurrence probabilities for genes and list with high vertex degrees , which are giving rise to a large part of all co - occurrences in the bipartite graph .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Since large occurrence probabilities make co - occurrence more likely , the analysis becomes more stringent .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Co - occurrence probabilities", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Co - occurrence analysis can be thought of as a Bernoulli experiment with a binomial outcome ( a given combination of entries is either present or not present in a given list ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Thus , the Binomial distribution ( BD ) is a natural choice for judging the significance of the number of co - occurrences .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , the BD is defined for a probability of success which is equal in all trials .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The list - specific nature of occurrence probabilities is not compatible with this condition ( analysis of each list represents one trial ) , which means that co - occurrence analysis in the presence of list - length - heterogeneity is better described as a series of Poisson trials , where the probability of success varies from trial to trial .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Therefore , the significance of co - occurrences must be evaluated using a binomial distribution with trial - specific probabilities , i . e . the Poisson - binomial distribution ( PBD ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The probability of success in a single Poisson trial can be calculated by multiplying the list - specific occurrence probabilities for the combination of genes under study .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The number of occurrence probabilities that need to be multiplied is equal to the module size , i . e . the number of genes whose combination is studied .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "An observed number of co - occurrences for a combination of genes can then be evaluated using the PBD , which is given by the formula [ 36 ] : ( 18 )", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The structure of this formula is very similar to the structure of the formula used to calculate the binomial distribution , except that multiplication with a binomial coefficient is replaced by summation over individual terms , which makes calculation of P - values using ( 18 ) inefficient ( note that equation numbering starts in the Materials and Methods section ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Here , Ak denotes the kth set of indices of the i lists where genes are co - occurring ( \" success \" ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "There are possible sets and summation is carried out accordingly . denotes the set of indices of N - i lists where genes are not co - occurring ( \" failure \" ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "[ 36 ] have reported two fast procedures for calculating exact PBD P - values .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , both procedures work with probability ratios and suffer from numerical overflow / underflow problems for large numbers of trials .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "NetCutter uses two workarounds to circumvent this problem .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "One is based on using Poisson - binomial Z - scores , which can be calculated very easily instead ( see below ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The other relies on a fast approximation procedure for calculating Poisson - binomial P - values , which we call bi - binomial approximation ( BBA ) or bi - binomial distribution ( BBD ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Z - scores and P - values of BBD", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Given the mean mu ( 1 ) and variance sigma 2 ( 2 ) of PBD ( see Materials and Methods ) , the Z - score associated with a given number of co - occurrences x is obtained as : ( 19 )", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Considering the structure of formulae ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ( Materials and Methods section ) , PBD Z - scores can be calculated very easily and provide a simple estimate of the significance of co - occurrence modules .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , in contrast to normally distributed Z - scores , binomial and Poisson - binomial Z - scores do not correspond to the same P - value for different sets of probabilities of success .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "To see this , calculate for example the probability of success in a series of 100 Bernoulli trials with success probability 0 . 1 and 0 . 9 for the expectation of 10 and 90 successes , respectively .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The Z - score will be 0 in both cases but the corresponding cumulative P - values are 0 . 5832 and 0 . 5487 .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Therefore , exact levels of significance cannot be derived from Z - scores alone .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Thus , a fast and reliable procedure for calculating Poisson - binomial P - values is needed .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The BBD approximation was developed to solve this problem .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The BBD approximation of PBD P - values follows from the relationship between the variance of PBD and the population variance of trial - specific probabilities of success .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This relationship is shown in Materials and Methods to be described by ( 4 ) : ( 4 )", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This equation shows that there is an inverse linear relationship between the population variance S2 of the N trial probabilities and the variance of PBD sigma 2 , which means that PBD becomes increasingly narrow as the variance of trial probabilities grows .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "It also shows that , for constant mean mu and number of trials N , the shape of PBD depends only on the variance of trial probabilities .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Therefore , relationship ( 4 ) suggests an easy way to approximate PBD P - values .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The P - value can be obtained by constructing a set of trial probabilities with equal variance as the original set of trial probabilities , which , however , are not all different .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In other words , the series of Poisson trials can be replaced by two sets of Bernoulli trials with trial probabilities p1 and p2 constructed such that the variance is equal to the original set of trial probabilities .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This strategy is illustrated in Fig .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "4 and explains why this approximation is called bi - binomial .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The details on how to obtain the values of the two sets of Bernoulli trial probabilities and the number of trials with p1 and p2 as probabilities of success are provided in the Materials and Methods section .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The precision of the BBD approximation is discussed in supplementary material Simulation S1 .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In order to evaluate whether BBD P - values as a significance measure of co - occurrence offer an advantage over other measures such as the Jaccard coefficient or the uncertainty coefficient , pair - wise co - occurrence of two genes in 200 lists with and without list - length - heterogeneity was studied ( Fig . 5 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Each gene is assumed to occur in 100 lists .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Therefore , the occurrence probabilities of both genes over all 200 lists must add up to 100 , regardless of list - length - heterogeneity .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "For simplicity , occurrence probabilities of both genes are assumed to be equal in any particular list .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The co - occurrence probability in a list is then given by the square of the occurrence probability in that list .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "For all possible co - occurrences from 0 to 100 , the Jaccard and uncertainty coefficients were calculated as detailed in the Materials and Methods section .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In addition , cumulative BBD P - values were calculated using the co - occurrence probabilities as trial probabilities .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "To illustrate the advantage of BBD over BD as co - occurrence probability distribution , cumulative BD P - values of a BD with the same mean as BBD but constant trial probabilities is shown .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "These trial probabilities can be obtained by dividing the mean of BBD by the number of lists .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Three different cases of list - length - heterogeneity are considered in Fig .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "5 : No heterogeneity ( standard deviation 0 ) , heterogeneity with standard deviation 0 . 283 and heterogeneity with standard deviation 0 . 401 in the occurrence probabilities .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The Jaccard and uncertainty coefficients are by definition insensitive to list - length - heterogeneity because differences in co - occurrence probabilities in a given list cannot be considered in their calculation .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This is because both coefficients are defined by the counts of the four list classes : both genes absent , both genes present , first gene absent second gene present , and first gene present second gene absent , i . e . by the corresponding contingency table , which does not change with different list - length - heterogeneity .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In the absence of list - length - heterogeneity , the cumulative P - values of BD and BBD ( which are perfectly overlapping as expected ) assume 0 . 5 at 50 co - occurrences , which corresponds to the expected number of co - occurrences calculated as ( 50 = 100 occurrences per gene / 200 lists ) ^ 2 * 200 lists .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The uncertainty coefficient is found to be 0 and the Jaccard coefficient is 0 . 33333 at that point .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "When there is modest list - length - heterogeneity ( standard deviation 0 . 283 ) , the mean of BBD is shifting to the right .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This is because the sum of squares of varying occurrence probabilities ( i . e . the sum of co - occurrence probabilities used as trial probabilities , which is equal to the mean of BBD ) is always larger than the sum of squares of constant occurrence probabilities with the same average occurrence probability ( 0 . 5 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The corresponding BD in the presence of list - length - heterogeneity is obtained by dividing the expected number of co - occurrences by the total number of lists , which means assuming equal co - occurrences in all lists .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This visualization is shown to illustrate how BBD ( which is narrower than the corresponding BD ) gives rise to a steeper cumulative distribution of P - values and as a consequence to more significant P - values for numbers of co - occurrence that are far from the expectation .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "As the level of list - length - heterogeneity grows ( standard deviation of occurrence probabilities 0 . 401 ) , the mean of BBD is shifted even further to the right and BBD P - values are distributed in a still steeper fashion as compared to corresponding BD P - values and the interval of non - significant co - occurrences is shrinking further .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "With modest list - length - heterogeneity , the expected number of co - occurrences is 66 , which is associated with a Jaccard coefficient of 0 . 49 and an uncertainty coefficient of 0 . 075 .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In the case of large list - length - heterogeneity , the expected number of co - occurrences is 82 with J = 0 . 69 and UC = 0 . 32 .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Taken together , these data show that the expected number of co - occurrences varies strongly with the level of list - length - heterogeneity and that the expected number of co - occurrences is associated with different values of UC and J .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "To complicate matters further , 66 co - occurrences ( J = 0 . 49 , UC = 0 . 075 ) represent significant positive association ( PBBD = 0 . 996 ) with equal list lengths , no significant association with modest differences in list length ( PBBD = 0 . 536 ) and strongly negative association ( meaning one gene excludes the other ) with strong list - length - heterogeneity ( PBBD = 0 . 00016 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Thus , the same J and UC association measure is obtained for positive , negative , and absence of association .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Therefore , the meaning of these measures cannot be interpreted properly in the absence of knowledge about the occurrence probabilities of the co - occurring entities .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Furthermore , the data in Fig .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "5 also show that neither J nor UC can distinguish between positive and negative association while this is easy with cumulative BBD P - values : Large P - values mean positive association and low P - values mean negative association .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In summary , we conclude that BBD provides a novel association measure that offers a number of advantages over the existing contingency table based association measures Jaccard coefficient and uncertainty coefficient .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The results in Fig .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "5 also show that significance of association depends critically on the specific distribution of co - occurring entities over lists of varying length ( because this distribution determines the occurrence probabilities ) and that contingency table based methods ( which cannot capture this distribution ) should be avoided in the presence of significant list - length - heterogeneity .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Second , co - occurrence of PubMedID _ listIDs was analyzed .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "To this end , the order of PubMedID _ listID - gene pairs was reversed to form GENE - PUBMEDID _ LISTID pairs .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Occurrence probabilities for the reversed bipartite graph can be obtained by transposing the occurrence probability matrix of the original bipartite graph .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Since the gene communities identified in gene co - occurrence analysis reflect the structure inherent in the bipartite graph ( which is not affected by reversing the list - entry order ) , co - occurrence analysis of the reversed bipartite graph will result in PubMedID _ listID communities that reflect the same underlying structure in the bipartite graph .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In other words , PubMedID _ listID communities correspond to gene communities .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In less abstract terms , the PubMedID _ listID communities should correspond to sets of publications that report similar sets of genes as differentially regulated .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "The clusters are very similar to the clusters published previously [ 35 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "There is one new cluster that is strongly enriched for ribosomal proteins ( \" protein biosynthesis \" cluster ) , which has not reached significance in our previous analysis .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The \" surface antigen \" cluster contains many genes that had been reported as part of the \" signal transduction \" cluster .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Altogether , however , these results strongly support the notion that the gene clusters in the PubLiME data set can be reproduced by the more fine - grained analysis that considers sublists in each publication as separate signatures .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The corresponding clusters of PubMedID _ listIDs are shown in Fig .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "6B .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "There are five clusters , which have been named after their corresponding gene cluster .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Only one cluster ( the \" extracellular matrix - immune response cluster \" ) cannot be separated by edge - betweenness clustering at the point of maximal graph modularity .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "To see that this naming is indeed justified , we needed to investigate how strongly a given PubMedID _ listID is associated with a given gene cluster , i . e . how significant is the overlap of the genes reported in a gene cluster and the genes reported in a PubMedID _ listID .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Binomial or hypergemetric statistics are generally used to calculate this significance .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , the bipartite graph model in conjunction with the edge - swapping null - model offers a more fine - grained approach based on bi - binomial statistics .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The edge - swapping null - model determines occurrence probabilities in such a way that the number of genes in a given PubMedID _ listID is associated with insignificant P - values in the context of the complete bipartite graph .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , when a subset of genes is analyzed , e . g . all the genes that are reported in a particular list , the P - value associated with the number of genes contained in this list will likely be highly significant according to how unlikely it is to obtain all the genes contained in a given list in a random draw from all genes present in the bipartite graph .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Thus , PubMedID _ listID association with a set of genes in the bipartite graph model can be calculated in the following way : The set of genes that is used to analyze association is used to extract a subgraph from the original bipartite graph where occurrence probabilities for each gene - PubMedID _ listID pair are identical to those in the original bipartite graph ( i . e . they are not recalculated by edge - swapping ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The vertex degree of the PubMedID _ listID vertices in the subgraph indicates the number of genes contained in each PubMedID _ listID overlapping with the set of genes used to extract the subgraph .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "For comparison , binomial and hypergeometric P - values are also shown .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "It can be seen that the bi - binomial P - value is larger than the binomial and hypergeometric P - values , which means that the strength of association is evaluated in a more stringent manner using BBD statistics ( see Discussion for an explanation of this observation ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The analysis of significant associations between PubMedID _ listIDs and gene clusters now permit answering the question whether there is correspondence between gene clusters and PubMedID _ listID clusters .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "First , for each gene cluster , all the PubMedID _ listIDs that are associated with that cluster with more than 95 % confidence ( i . e . cumulative bi - binomial P - values > = 0 . 95 ) were identified .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Second , the number of significant PubMedID _ listIDs in each PubMedID _ listID cluster was counted for every gene cluster .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The significance of this number was then calculated using binomial statistics .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The results of this analysis are shown in Table 1 .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Negative decadic logarithms of the binomial P - value are displayed .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "It is apparent that each PubMedID _ listID cluster is strongly associated with at least one gene cluster , except for the \" extracellular matrix - immune response \" cluster , which is associated with two gene clusters .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The strength of these associations suggests that the PubMedID _ listID clusters are indeed corresponding to the gene clusters and that both the gene and the PubMedID _ listID clusters reflect the structure of the bipartite graph representing the PubLiME data set .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Details about all the lists analyzed are attached as supplementary material Table S2 .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Looking at these lists , some general conclusions about the gene clusters can be drawn .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Cell cycle cluster genes have been found deregulated in a wide variety of tumor types such as colon cancer , breast cancer , in biliary tract cancer , pancreatic cancer , gastric cancer , prostate cancer , T - cell leukemia , glioma , acute lymphoblastic and myeloblastic leukemias , soft tissue sarcoma , neuroblastoma , as well as in a number of cellular model systems in response to different stimuli .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Thus , the cell cycle cluster seems to consist of genes with a general role in oncogenesis .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The surface antigen cluster instead seems to be derived preferentially from studies on leukemia .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The interferon cluster genes are found deregulated in virus induced pathologies such as papilloma virus induced cervical cancer , and viral hepatitis .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Immune response cluster genes were reported as differentially regulated in inflammatory conditions such as ulcerative colitis , Crohn ' s disease , and Helicobacter pylori infections .", "tgt": "Helicobacter pylori [EOS]"}
{"src": "Genes of the extracellular matrix cluster seem to be associated with cancer progression studies and metastatic potential .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "For the protein biosynthesis cluster , there are 15 signatures that are significantly enriched for those genes .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The cancers studied comprise medulloblastoma , glioblastoma , pancreatic cancer , soft tissue sarcoma , lung carcinoma , breast carcinoma , prostate carcinoma , multiple myeloma , and lymphocytic leukemia .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The genes are also found deregulated in response to DNA damage .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Although the number of signatures is limited , the variation in conditions where the genes are deregulated is compatible with the hypothesis that protein biosynthesis genes , as cell cycle genes , are deregulated in many cancer types , which might reflect the general property of cancer cells to divide and grow in an uncontrolled fashion .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Discussion", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Here we have investigated basic aspects of co - occurrence analysis and present a software tool , NetCutter , which can be used to identify and analyze generic co - occurrence networks .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In NetCutter , a co - occurrence data set is represented as a bipartite graph with one part representing lists and the other part list entries whose co - occurrence patterns are studied .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The bipartite graph representation of co - occurrence data sets allows the efficacy of different null - models to be tested systematically .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We have shown that an edge - swapping procedure used to randomize the bipartite graph generates a null - model that allows co - occurrence analysis with the highest stringency .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The other null - models tested here tend to underestimate occurrence probabilities of entries per list for lists and genes with high vertex degrees , i . e . for lists and genes where most co - occurrences are observed .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "As a result , co - occurrences are judged more significant than they really are .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Co - occurrence data sets with exactly equal lists lengths are likely to be the exception from the rule .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "It can be assumed that some list - length - heterogeneity will be present in most circumstances .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "An important consequence of list - length - heterogeneity regards the co - occurrence probability distribution used to evaluate the significance of the observed number of co - occurrences .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Co - occurrence analysis in the presence of list - length - heterogeneity is best performed using the Poisson - binomial distribution ( a binomial distribution with trial specific probabilities ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , calculating Poisson - binomial P - values for large numbers of lists is difficult using existing procedures [ 36 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We have presented an approximation to the Poisson - binomial distribution , called bi - binomial distribution , which is based on replacing the set of Poisson trials by two sets of Bernoulli trials .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The resulting distribution reproduces the Poisson - binomial distribution nearly exactly and its P - values can be calculated with ease even for thousands of lists ( see also supplementary material Simulation S1 for details on the precision of BBD ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Importantly , BBD provides a novel measure of association , which is shown to be superior to existing measures such as the Jaccard coefficient and the uncertainty coefficient , whose values cannot be interpreted properly in the absence of knowledge about the occurrence probabilities of co - occurring entities .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "It is worth noting that Poisson - binomial Z - scores are distinguished from Gaussian Z - scores by the fact that they do not correspond to the same P - value for different PBDs , BBDs , and even BDs .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This is because the Z - score is an explicit part of the function defining the normal probability density while it is not part of the definitions of BD , PBD , and BBD densities .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "As a consequence , the simple Poisson - binomial Z - score based approach to evaluating significance of co - occurrence must be complemented with the BBD to approximate Poisson - binomial P - values in order to enable multiple testing corrections and to allow calculation of confidence levels in association studies precisely .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , NetCutter is equipped with a bipartite graph randomization tool that permits measuring the number of false positives due to multiple testing directly by comparing the number of significant co - occurrence modules in the real bipartite graph to the corresponding number in a randomized version thereof .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Randomization is performed by edge - swapping in order to preserve vertex degrees .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The resulting signal - to - noise ratios that are plotted for each Z - score / P - value cutoff provide a highly reliable and visually intuitive defense mechanism against false positives ( see also supplementary material Simulation S1 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In the vast majority of co - occurrence studies , pair - wise co - occurrences have been analyzed using different statistical models .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We have observed that the stringency of pair - wise co - occurrence analysis is far below the stringency of co - occurrence analysis using higher order combinations of co - occurring entities [ 35 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In NetCutter , co - occurrence analysis is preceded by occurrence analysis , i . e . the occurrence probability of each entry in each list is determined .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Starting from occurrence probabilities , co - occurrence probabilities for any size of co - occurrence modules under study can be obtained by multiplying the respective list - specific occurrence probabilities .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Given the list - specific co - occurrence probabilities , bi - binomial P - values are then calculated in exactly the same way for any module size .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "As a consequence , NetCutter can perform co - occurrence analysis for higher order combinations of co - occurring entries ( i . e . larger module sizes ) using the same statistical model .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "One of the benefits of using higher module sizes is robustness of the analyses in the presence of noise .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This is because each edge in the resulting co - occurrence network is evaluated many times since every pair of co - occurring entries can be part of many higher order co - occurrence modules [ 35 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Another advantage is that implicit relationships between entries , which have never occurred together [ 18 ] , can be derived as a natural by - product of using module sizes larger than 2 .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "As shown in a simulation study ( supplementary material Simulation S1 ) , the result is a dramatic reduction of misclassifications at higher module sizes .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "NetCutter can be used to calculate the strength of association between a subset of entries and lists reporting those entries .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In this case , the analysis is performed on a subgraph of the original bipartite graph .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The subgraph can correspond to communities of entries in the co - occurrence network , or any set of entries of interest .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "NetCutter will then calculate the significance of observing a given number of occurrences of an entry in the user defined subset of lists using bi - binomal statistics .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This analysis mode corresponds to association studies with the advantage that the structure of the underlying bipartite graph ( i . e . list length heterogeneity ) is considered and handled appropriately using the bi - binomial distribution .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "As a consequence , association studies can be performed with higher stringency .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This result can be understood by examining the occurrence probability matrix that is implicitly assumed in performing binomial or hypergeometric tests for the significance of overlaps .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In both tests , a gene is assumed to have an equal opportunity to be present in a list .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Therefore , the probability of success for a gene to be part of a list is given by the list vertex degree divided by the total number of genes .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In other words , both tests are implicitly based on the list vertex degree model , which has been shown previously to underestimate the occurrence probability and the expected number of co - occurrences for genes with high vertex degree ( see Fig . 2A ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Since the BBD P - values are calculated from the ES - model , which assigns higher occurrence probabilities to genes with higher vertex degree and more expected co - occurrences , the observed number of overlaps between a set of genes of interest and the content of a given list ( which can be viewed as co - occurrence of the overlapping genes in that list ) will be judged less significant when the overlapping genes are of high vertex degree ( and vice versa when the overlapping genes are of low vertex degree ) as compared to binomial or hypergeometric tests .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Since the BBD P - values are derived from the most stringent ES null - model , BBD P - values provide a more reliable estimate for the significance of overlap .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Co - occurrence analysis of data represented as bipartite graphs permits visualizing the structure of the bipartite graph either as communities of list entries ( genes ) or as communities of lists ( PubMedID _ ListID ) in co - occurrence networks .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We have analyzed the PubLiME data set for the presence of corresponding gene and list clusters .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In addition to previously published clusters of genes , we describe a novel gene cluster that is composed of protein biosynthesis associated genes [ 35 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We found that the corresponding clusters of PubMedID _ ListID ( gene expression signatures ) are in general strongly enriched for genes reported in the corresponding gene cluster and that interrogation of corresponding clusters can be used to deduct hypotheses about the putative function of gene clusters .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In addition to co - occurrence analysis , NetCutter offers a number of tools for the analysis of co - occurrence networks , or any undirected graph .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In particular , community identification is supported by four different community identification algorithms .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "NetCutter also offers a range of convenience functions that are of help in network analysis .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Worthy of mentioning are the random graph generators that can provide control graphs for topological studies .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The complete set of options is described in the software documentation .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In summary , we present a general framework for co - occurrence analysis with many potential applications .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We illustrate a number of advantages of using the bipartite graph representation of data and the associated statistics .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In particular , the identification of corresponding clusters permits the identification of functional subunits such as gene clusters on the one hand , and the generation of hypotheses about the function of those units by analyzing the corresponding list clusters on the other hand .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Future developments will be directed towards the analysis of data sets that are considerably larger than the data sets analyzed so far .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "For example , co - occurrence analysis might be of interest for the analysis of single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) data sets and association studies of genome variability with disease .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Co - occurrence patterns of patients according to their SNPs could be compared to clinical parameters with the aim of identifying genomic regions associated with disease .", "tgt": "patients [EOS]"}
{"src": "The increased stringency of association studies offered by NetCutter may be of use in the analysis of polygenic diseases where conventional methods fail .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "The bi - binomial distribution is a special case of the Poisson - binomial distribution where the probability of success can assume only two values .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In order to achieve a good approximation of the underlying Poisson - binomial distribution , the values of these two probabilities and the number of trials where they are assumed must be determined carefully .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Conclusion", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Apart from access to local amenities , environmental characteristics may have limited influence on active travel in deprived urban populations characterised by a low level of car ownership , in which people may have less capacity for making discretionary travel choices than the populations studied in most published research on the environmental correlates of physical activity .", "tgt": "people [EOS]"}
{"src": "Background", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Until recently , research on correlates of physical activity was dominated by studies of individual demographic and psychosocial characteristics [ 1 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This reflected an emphasis on promoting sport , recreation or health - directed exercise using techniques to encourage individual behaviour change [ 2 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , there is little evidence that such approaches are effective in increasing physical activity in the medium - to - long term [ 3 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "If habitual patterns of behaviour are environmentally cued , sustained change is likely to require a supportive environment in which people can be active [ 4 , 5 ] .", "tgt": "people [EOS]"}
{"src": "There is therefore increasing interest in the influence of the social and physical environment on physical activity .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "With respect to the physical ( natural or built ) environment , a growing body of evidence suggests that certain environmental characteristics may be associated with patterns of physical activity in general or with particular types of physical activity such as walking or cycling as modes of transport [ 4 - 10 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Among the correlates most frequently identified in such reviews - some ascertained using ' objective ' measures , and others in terms of people ' s perceptions - are the aesthetic quality of the surroundings , the presence of pavements ( sidewalks ) , the convenience of facilities for being active , the availability of green space , access to amenities ( destinations ) within walking or cycling distance , safety from traffic and personal attack , and the lack of heavy traffic .", "tgt": "people [EOS]"}
{"src": "Some of these local characteristics reflect higher - order aspects of urban design and spatial policy such as population density , connectivity and mixed land use [ 6 , 8 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Importantly , different characteristics may be associated with different types of physical activity ; for example , Owen and colleagues found that the aesthetic quality of the surroundings was associated with walking for exercise or recreation and with walking in general , but not with walking for transport , whereas perceptions of traffic were associated with walking for transport and walking in general , but not with walking for exercise or recreation [ 5 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Despite the growing volume of published studies in this field , many authors remain circumspect in their interpretation of the available evidence .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Giles - Corti and Donovan have described access to a supportive physical environment as a necessary , but insufficient , condition for an increase in physical activity in the population [ 11 ] , while Handy found ' convincing ' evidence of an association between physical activity and the built environment in general but ' less convincing ' evidence as to which specific environmental characteristics were most strongly associated [ 7 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "One limitation of the available evidence is that most research has been conducted in North America and Australia [ 9 , 12 ] , and it is not clear whether associations observed in those countries are generalisable to other settings with different aggregate socioeconomic characteristics ( e . g . wealth or access to private cars ) or environmental characteristics ( e . g . climate , patterns of land use , or availability of public transport ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "For example , North American researchers are often interested in the presence or absence of pavements ( sidewalks ) , but it is unusual for streets in the United Kingdom ( UK ) not to have a pavement or footpath beside them .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Hypotheses about putative environmental correlates of physical activity therefore need to be tested in a wider range of settings .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "A more profound limitation of the available evidence is that identifying a relationship between , for example , urban form and walking for transport is not the same thing as showing that changing the built environment will lead to a change in behaviour [ 13 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Few researchers have taken up the opportunity ( or challenge ) presented by ' natural experiments ' to investigate the effects of environmental interventions on physical activity [ 14 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We therefore established a longitudinal study to examine changes associated with the opening of a new urban section of the M74 motorway ( freeway ) currently under construction in Glasgow , Scotland .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The rationale and design for this study have been described previously [ 15 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "It is claimed that the new motorway , which will mostly pass through or close to densely - populated urban neighbourhoods , will contribute to the regeneration of a region which includes some of the most deprived and least healthy working - class communities in Europe [ 16 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "It is also claimed that the new motorway will divert traffic from local streets , reduce traffic noise and bring new local employment opportunities , thereby improving characteristics of the local environment held to be associated with active travel .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Others claim that the new motorway will encourage car use , degrade the aesthetic quality of the surroundings and reduce the safety and attractiveness of routes for pedestrians and cyclists across the line of the motorway - all changes which may be expected to discourage active travel [ 15 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The eventual aim of the M74 study will be to assess the effects of this major modification to the urban built environment and transport infrastructure on perceptions of the local environment and on population health and health - related behaviour , the primary outcome of interest being a change in the quantity of ' active travel ' ( walking and cycling for transport ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In this paper , we report findings from the cross - sectional ( baseline ) phase of the study which contribute evidence on the environmental correlates of physical activity in this comparatively deprived urban population .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We focus on two specific hypotheses : first , that levels of active travel and overall physical activity vary with demographic and socioeconomic characteristics , but not necessarily in the same way ; second , that these relationships may be partly explained by the perceived characteristics of the local environment in which people live and by their objectively - assessed proximity to motorway and major road infrastructure .", "tgt": "people [EOS]"}

{"src": "Some of the challenges of recruiting research participants in areas of deprivation have been described elsewhere [ 23 ] ; these are superimposed on a downward trend in participation in even the best - resourced national population surveys [ 24 ] and an upward ( and socially biased ) trend in opt - outs from the main alternative sampling frame , the edited electoral register [ 25 ] .", "tgt": "participants [EOS]"}
{"src": "Although our achieved sample contained a higher proportion of respondents from owner - occupied and car - owning households than predicted from 2001 census data for the same census output areas , these differences may be partly accounted for by an upward background trend in owner occupation and car access between 2001 and 2005 .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "The explanatory variables that were significantly associated with active travel but not with physical activity ( distance to place of work or study , access to a bicycle , access to a car , perceived proximity to shops , and perceived road safety for cyclists ) all have an obvious intuitive relationship with the use of walking or cycling as modes of transport .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "That they were not significantly associated with overall physical activity suggests either that active travel contributes only a minority of respondents ' overall physical activity or that other factors not measured in this study are more important correlates of overall physical activity than those which determine active travel .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "A crude comparision of the quantity of active travel reported in the one - day travel diaries with the quantities of physical activity reported using IPAQ suggests that on average , active travel may indeed make only a small ( ~ 15 % ) contribution to overall physical activity in this study population .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , the real contribution may be substantially greater than this if , as has been shown previously , respondents tend to over - report their physical activity using IPAQ [ 28 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "There can be little doubt that active travel makes a substantial contribution to the total quantity of walking reported in this study population .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Irrespective of the true contribution of active travel to overall physical activity , however , it remains likely that other unmeasured personal and social factors beyond the scope of this study may be more important correlates of overall physical activity .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Socio - spatial patterning of active travel and overall physical activity", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Respondents living in owner - occupied households were more likely to report active travel than those living in social - rented accommodation , but less likely to report sufficient overall physical activity .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Since neither working situation nor perceived financial situation emerged as significantly associated with active travel or overall physical activity , housing tenure and car access are the remaining explanatory variables in this dataset which can be interpreted as markers of socioeconomic status .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Although having access to a car clearly reflects the possession of a material asset , it has been argued that this is a less direct marker of socioeconomic status than some other markers because , in Scotland at least , access to a car is a more - or - less essential requirement for living in many rural areas , whereas it is possible to live in a dense urban settlement such as Glasgow without using a car .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In the final models in this study , therefore , housing tenure may be regarded as the primary marker of socioeconomic status .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The findings consequently suggest conflicting socioeconomic gradients in prevalence : more advantaged respondents were more likely to report active travel , but more disadvantaged respondents were more likely to report sufficient overall physical activity .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The higher prevalence of sufficient overall physical activity among the more disadvantaged despite their lower propensity for active travel is likely to reflect higher quantities of physical activity in other domains , particularly occupational and domestic activities , since leisure - time physical activity tends to be higher among more advantaged groups [ 29 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Environmental characteristics : paradoxical , unmeasured , or irrelevant ?", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The two environmental variables that emerged as significantly associated with active travel , particularly among those without access to a car , were perceived proximity to shops and perceived road safety for cyclists .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The positive association with perceived proximity to shops suggests that for active travel to be undertaken in this population , it may be more important that people live close to the amenities they need than that they live in an environment with more favourable subjective or discretionary considerations such as attractiveness or noise .", "tgt": "people [EOS]"}
{"src": "This would be consistent with an understanding that walking as a mode of transport is primarily a way of undertaking journeys which have to be made anyway , as opposed to more discretionary ( recreational ) forms of walking which may be more susceptible to the influence of less - structural characteristics .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Although the negative association with perceived road safety for cyclists appears counter - intuitive , similar ' paradoxical inverse relationships ' have been reported elsewhere , for example by Titze and colleagues in a study of the correlates of cycling among students [ 30 ] and by Humpel and colleagues in a study of correlates of walking for pleasure [ 31 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Titze and colleagues suggest that respondents who cycle regularly are more likely to be aware of , and report , the danger posed by traffic than non - cyclists or infrequent cyclists .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "A similar phenomenon could explain the negative association between physical activity and perception of traffic volume .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Overall , the influence of the putative environmental characteristics examined in this study on active travel and physical activity appeared small compared with that of the personal characteristics found to be significant , and including environmental characteristics in the models did not substantially modify the influence of personal characteristics .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "On the one hand , this could reflect an artefact of the research methods ( a false negative error ) , which could have arisen in various ways .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In particular , the ' wrong ' environmental exposure may have been measured , in that the environmental characteristics examined were those of the immediate surroundings of respondents ' homes , whereas the propensity to choose active modes of transport may be more strongly influenced by the characteristics of the environment elsewhere on their routes [ 30 ] , for example the perceived danger of cycling in the city centre - an association which may be absent , or at least diluted , when the ' exposure ' examined is limited to the residential environment .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "It could also be argued that the apparently weak influence of environmental characteristics in this study reflects a reliance on respondents ' perceptions which have not been objectively verified and may therefore be a weak proxy for the ' true ' objectively - measured characteristics of their surroundings .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , as recent reviews have pointed out , the current weight of evidence for objective environmental correlates of walking is no greater than that for subjective environmental correlates [ 5 ] and it is entirely plausible that people ' s perceptions of their environment may be at least as important as their objective conditions in influencing their behaviour [ 6 ] .", "tgt": "people [EOS]"}
{"src": "On the other hand , we may have demonstrated a real absence of any major association .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Although at first sight this appears at odds with the growing body of review - level evidence for environmental correlates of physical activity , Wendel - Vos and colleagues noted that of all the environmental factors examined in all the studies included in their review , analysis showed a ' null association ' in 76 % of cases [ 9 ] , and our finding that personal factors account for a much larger proportion of the variance in active travel or physical activity than is accounted for by environmental factors is consistent with those of some other European studies [ 32 , 33 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In the particular context of this study , residents may simply have adapted to adverse conditions in their local environment in the ways identified by Hedges in a qualitative study of people living close to new roads built in the UK in the 1970s [ 34 ] - particularly by attitudinal adaptation , which Hedges characterises as developing an attitude that it is futile to resist .", "tgt": "people [EOS]"}
{"src": "One can imagine that in the most deprived areas of Glasgow , people may have become resigned to the nature of their surroundings , seeing them as inevitable and not amenable to change either through environmental improvement or through their moving to another area .", "tgt": "people [EOS]"}
{"src": "Conclusion", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "After demographic and socioeconomic characteristics were taken into account , neither perceptions of the local environment nor objective proximity to major road infrastructure appeared to explain much of the variance in active travel or overall physical activity in this study .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Our study population may be both objectively constrained by their socioeconomic circumstances ( including comparatively limited access to private cars ) and adapted to living in conditions which others would consider to pose a barrier to active travel .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Under these circumstances , environmental characteristics which have been found to influence discretionary active travel in studies in other , more affluent populations may simply be irrelevant in a population which is more captive in its travel choices .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Environmental correlates of active travel should not be assumed to be generalisable between populations ; researchers should continue to test hypotheses about putative environmental correlates in different settings , and policymakers should recognise that the effects of interventions to change the environment are likely to vary between populations and between socioeconomic groups within populations .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Tubercle bacilli were shown to reside in these lipid - rich macrophages which were named foamy macrophages ( FMs ) [ 30 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Recently , histo - pathological analysis of biopsies from patients with untreated tuberculosis confirmed the century - old histological descriptions of postprimary tuberculosis [ 10 ] .", "tgt": "patients [EOS]"}
{"src": "In this study , Hunter et al showed that postprimary tuberculosis begins as a lipid pneumonia with the accumulation of large amounts of lipid - rich FMs , accompanied by bronchial obstruction .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "It was also shown that in alveolar foamy macrophages , the bacilli were mainly found within lipid droplets .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "All these observations underline the important , yet often neglected , role of lipid accumulation , and more precisely FM formation , at the infectious site in the physiopathology of TB .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In murine experimental models , FMs accumulate within the outermost layer of granulomatous structures occupying the alveolar spaces during the chronic phase of infection .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This strongly suggests that FMs could be involved in lesion cleaning via phagocytic uptake of cellular debris generated by the local inflammatory response .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Once filled with debris , FMs would leave the parenchyma through the alveolar spaces up to the superior bronchial tree , to be finally swallowed and digested in the stomach [ 31 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In fact , this process is very well known , and is a crucial factor for TB diagnosis in children .", "tgt": "children [EOS]"}
{"src": "As infants do not usually generate cavitary lesions , and because it is difficult to detect bacilli in the sputum , the diagnosis is linked to the detection of bacilli in the gastrointestinal lavage [ 32 ] .", "tgt": "infants [EOS]"}

{"src": "Although this event occurs more quickly than in vivo , or in animal models , our data are consistent with the above in vivo observations .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Within FMs , bacilli and LBs were often tightly linked , to the point that a non - negligible amount of bacteria were ultimately observed within LBs .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Interestingly , some of the bacilli transferred into lipid bodies displayed their own intracytoplasmic lipid inclusions , which are considered to be one of the hallmarks of non - replicating ( dormant ) M . tb [ 27 ] .", "tgt": "M . tb [EOS]"}
{"src": "The recent observation of persistent ILI - containing tubercle bacilli within adipocyte LBs [ 33 ] is in good agreement with our observations .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Since bacilli residing in phagosomes that do not interact with cellular lipid bodies do not display ILIs , it is tempting to assume that lipids within ILIs are of cellular origin .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The accumulation of lipids within bacilli [ 47 ] , via interaction with FM lipid bodies could , therefore , be crucial to M . tb persistence .", "tgt": "M . tb [EOS]"}
{"src": "It is indeed known that M . tb accumulates lipids , and more precisely triacylglycerols , during dormancy [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] from which it derives both carbon and energy for its own metabolism .", "tgt": "M . tb [EOS]"}
{"src": "Intracellular persistence of M . tb is also critically linked to the acquisition of host cholesterol through the Mce4 transporter system [ 36 ] .", "tgt": "M . tb [EOS]"}
{"src": "The question that arises is how do bacteria gain access to lipids from LB ?", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Direct fusion of phagosomes with FM lipid bodies seems unlikely as the membranes of both structures are quite different from one another .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Our observations suggest instead that once M . tb - containing phagosomes have established close contact with a lipid body , they surround and engulf the latter by a process that remains to be deciphered .", "tgt": "M . tb [EOS]"}
{"src": "This phenomenon is somewhat reminiscent of autophagy , as observed under conditions of cholesterol depletion in macrophages infected with M . avium [ 37 ] .", "tgt": "M . avium [EOS]"}

{"src": "How bacilli translocate the cellular lipids to their own cytoplasm remains to be established .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Another important phenomenon underlined by our study is the strong correlation between the presence of FMs in the granulomatous structures and the development of necrosis within the lesion , as suggested by Pagel over 80 years ago [ 29 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Interestingly , FMs were systematically located at the interface region between the histiocytes and the central necrosis area of the biopsied lesions .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Although necrosis formation could depend on an indirect effect of the global immune response , our data indicate that the formation of FMs is an important factor favoring the appearance of necrosis .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Analysis of larger series of biopsy samples are , however , needed to definitely demonstrate our actual hypothesis according to which FMs play a direct and unique role in necrosis formation .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Consistent with this hypothesis , we observed that FMs induced from M . tb - infected macrophages displayed permanent TNF - alpha secretion , a potent pro - necrotic factor , whereas M . smegmatis - infected macrophages were poor producers of TNF - alpha .", "tgt": "M . tb [SEP] M . smegmatis [EOS]"}
{"src": "At day 4 post - infection , TNF - alpha secretion was indeed twofold higher in macrophages ( of which 70 % had differentiated into FMs ) infected with M . tb than in those infected with M . smegmatis , as measured both by ELISA and RNA quantification ( Peyron , unpublished observations ) .", "tgt": "M . tb [SEP] M . smegmatis [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , one must keep in mind that the association of FMs and necrosis may be the consequence of the FM cleaning process of lipoproteins released into the necrotic tissue , as observed in atherosclerosis lesions [ 38 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "It is thus tempting to propose that M . tb mycolic acids may be responsible for the development of necrotic lesions , due to their ability to induce TNF - alpha production by FMs .", "tgt": "M . tb [EOS]"}
{"src": "Whether mycolic acids are directly involved in TNF - alpha production , or only indirectly by inducing FM formation , remains a matter of debate currently under study .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Our observations are strikingly similar to the phenomena described for postprimary tuberculosis , that seems to begin as localized foci of pneumonia followed by massive necrosis leading to the formation of pulmonary cavities [ 10 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "If this proves to be the case , then the traditionally admitted phenomenon of cavitation arising from the erosion of caseating granulomatous structures from bronchi can be ruled out [ 39 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In our study , we successfully induced FM formation from isolated macrophages infected with M . tb , i . e . outside a granulomatous structure , which is consistent with Hunter ' s recent proposal .", "tgt": "M . tb [EOS]"}

{"src": "M . tb - specific mycolic acids indeed trigger the transformation of both isolated and granuloma macrophages , into FM .", "tgt": "M . tb [EOS]"}
{"src": "Given the absence of FM formation in M . smegmatis - induced granulomas , despite the induction of a comparative inflammatory response , ascertained by the similar induction of granulomas , this phenomenon clearly depends upon a direct contact with the bacilli , and not to the inflammatory response .", "tgt": "M . smegmatis [EOS]"}
{"src": "Mycolic acids are major and hallmark components of the mycobacterial cell wall .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "They constitute 40 - 60 % of dry weight of the envelope [ 42 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "All members of the complex ( e . g . M . tb , Mycobacterium africanum , Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium microti ) are able to synthesize the same combination of mycolic acids , i . e . cyclopropanated alpha - mycolic acids , ketomycolic and methoxymycolic acids [ 17 ] , which are not synthesized by non - pathogenic mycobacterial species [ 43 ] .", "tgt": "M . tb [SEP] Mycobacterium africanum [SEP] Mycobacterium bovis [SEP] Mycobacterium microti [EOS]"}

{"src": "Our study , therefore , gives the first proof of a direct role of isolated mycolic acids in the interplay between M . tb and host cells .", "tgt": "M . tb [EOS]"}

{"src": "Conclusions", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Our data show that people with visual impairment due to cataract were poorer than those with normal sight in all three low - income countries studied .", "tgt": "people [EOS]"}
{"src": "The MDGs are committed to the eradication of extreme poverty and provision of health care to poor people , and this study highlights the need for increased provision of cataract surgery to poor people , as they are particularly vulnerable to visual impairment from cataract .", "tgt": "people [SEP] people [EOS]"}
{"src": "Background .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Globally , about 45 million people are blind .", "tgt": "people [EOS]"}
{"src": "As with many other conditions , avoidable blindness ( preventable or curable blindness ) is a particular problem for people in developing countries - - 90 % of blind people live in poor regions of the world .", "tgt": "people [SEP] people [EOS]"}
{"src": "Although various infections and disorders can cause blindness , cataract is the most common cause .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In cataract , which is responsible for half of all cases of blindness in the world , the lens of the eye gradually becomes cloudy .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Because the lens focuses light to produce clear , sharp images , as cataract develops , vision becomes increasingly foggy or fuzzy , colors become less intense , and the ability to see shapes against a background declines .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Eventually , vision may be lost completely .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Cataract can be treated with an inexpensive , simple operation in which the cloudy lens is surgically removed and an artificial lens is inserted into the eye to restore vision .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In developed countries , this operation is common and easily accessible but many poor countries lack the resources to provide the operation to everyone who needs it .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In addition , blind people often cannot afford to travel to the hospitals where the operation , which also may come with a fee , is done .", "tgt": "people [EOS]"}
{"src": "Why Was This Study Done ?", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Because blindness may reduce earning potential , many experts believe that poverty and blindness ( and , more generally , poor health ) are inextricably linked .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "People become ill more often in poor countries than in wealthy countries because they have insufficient food , live in substandard housing , and have limited access to health care , education , water , and sanitation .", "tgt": "People [EOS]"}
{"src": "Once they are ill , their ability to earn money may be reduced , which increases their personal poverty and slows the economic development of the whole country .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Because of this potential link between health and poverty , improvements in health are at the heart of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals , a set of eight goals established in 2000 with the primary aim of reducing world poverty .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , few studies have actually investigated the complex relationship between poverty and health .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Here , the researchers investigate the association between visual impairment from cataract and poverty among adults living in three low - income countries .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "What Did the Researchers Do and Find ?", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The researchers identified nearly 600 people aged 50 y or more with severe cataract - induced visual impairment ( \" cases \" ) primarily through a survey of the population in Kenya , Bangladesh , and the Philippines .", "tgt": "people [EOS]"}
{"src": "They matched each case to a normally sighted ( \" control \" ) person of similar age and sex living nearby .", "tgt": "person [EOS]"}
{"src": "They then assessed a proxy for the income level , measured as \" per capita expenditure \" ( PCE ) , of all the study participants ( people with cataracts and controls ) by collecting information about what their households consumed .", "tgt": "participants [SEP] people [EOS]"}
{"src": "The participants ' housing conditions and other assets and their self - rated wealth were also measured .", "tgt": "participants [EOS]"}
{"src": "In all three countries , cases were more likely to be in the lowest quarter ( quartile ) of the range of PCEs for that country than controls .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In the Philippines , for example , people with cataract - affected vision were three times more likely than normally sighted controls to have a PCE in the lowest quartile than in the highest quartile .", "tgt": "people [EOS]"}
{"src": "The risk of cataract - related visual impairment increased as PCE decreased in all three countries .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Similarly , severe cataract - induced visual impairment was more common in those who owned fewer assets and those with lower self - rated wealth .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , there was no consistent association between PCE and the level of cataract - induced visual impairment .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "What Do These Findings Mean ?", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "These findings show that there is an association between visual impairment caused by cataract and poverty in Kenya , Bangladesh , and the Philippines .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , because the financial circumstances of the people in this study were assessed after cataracts had impaired their sight , this study does not prove that poverty is a cause of visual impairment .", "tgt": "people [EOS]"}
{"src": "A causal connection between poverty and cataract can only be shown by determining the PCEs of normally sighted people and following them for several years to see who develops cataract .", "tgt": "people [EOS]"}
{"src": "Nevertheless , by confirming an association between poverty and blindness , these findings highlight the need for increased provision of cataract surgery to poor people , particularly since cataract surgery has the potential to improve the quality of life for many people in developing countries at a relatively low cost .", "tgt": "people [SEP] people [EOS]"}

{"src": "Introduction", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Improvements in health are at the heart of the Millennium Development Goals , with the recognition that better health is central to the primary aim of reducing poverty as well as important in its own right .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Empirical data are needed to back up this claim .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Unravelling the relationship between blindness and poverty therefore has important implications , and may also be informative for the association between poverty and other disabilities .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Blindness is a common condition globally , affecting approximately 45 million people , and more than a third of blindness is caused by cataract [ 1 , 2 ] .", "tgt": "people [EOS]"}
{"src": "Globally , the prevalence of blindness is five - fold higher in poor than rich countries [ 2 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Limited data show that within countries the poor are also more likely to be blind [ 3 , 4 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "It is frequently asserted that blindness is both a cause and consequence of poverty , but there are few empirical data to support this claim .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Poverty may cause cataract blindness , because access to cataract surgery is limited in low - income countries [ 5 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Furthermore , within poor countries some evidence suggests that lack of money is a major barrier to uptake of cataract surgery by individuals [ 6 - 8 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Blindness may also cause poverty , as the blind individual , or the household members who care for them , have a reduced earning potential [ 4 , 9 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This complex problem could have serious implications ; estimates from The Gambia suggest that there is a substantial economic burden from lost productivity among blind people [ 10 ] .", "tgt": "people [EOS]"}
{"src": "Therefore , blindness prevention may ultimately be cost saving [ 11 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Extrapolations on a global level indicate that a successful eye care programme could prevent more than 100 million cases of blindness between 2000 and 2020 , and consequently save at least US $ 102 billion , which would otherwise be lost to reductions in productivity associated with blindness [ 12 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , these estimates are based on extrapolations from limited data and were not based on individual - level data .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "It is also difficult to identify the component of productivity loss that is due to blindness , as this condition mainly affects older people , who may suffer from other comorbidities that restrict their employment opportunities or make them dependent on the care of others .", "tgt": "people [EOS]"}
{"src": "The Cataract Impact Study was undertaken to assess the relationship between cataract visual impairment and \" economic poverty \" and quality of life , and to estimate the impact of cataract surgery on these factors in three low - income countries .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The aim of the current paper is to assess the association at baseline between visual impairment from cataract and household poverty ( measured through consumption , asset ownership , and self - rated wealth ) in a population - based case - control study in Kenya , the Philippines , and Bangladesh .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "There are numerous interpretations of this great diversity , and most tend to be related to adaptation to external conditions such as climate or nutritional status .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Dependence of folate degradation on skin pigmentation [ 17 ] , nutritional habits or human intervention periconceptional periods could explain this genetic variation .", "tgt": "human [EOS]"}
{"src": "Definitely , external factors in combination with different levels of MTHFR enzyme activity , conditioned by polymorphisms , could influence the fetal viability of certain genotypes .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In 1998 , we suggested the possibility of genetic selection in Spain in favor of the mutants of the 677C > T polymorphism in the MTHFR gene based on the fact that treatment with vitamins and folates during pregnancy increased the viability of fetuses with the TT homozygous genotype .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "That study hypothesized about fetal viability and about a genetic selection model on the basis of non - linkage disequilibrium between both polymorphisms .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Recently , a study with fetal and control populations showed the strong influence of these polymorphisms , though mainly of the 677C > T polymorphism , on spontaneous early abortion [ 21 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In the present study , significant changes in allelic and genotypic frequencies are detected , as is Hardy - Weinberg disequilibrium , at the 677C > T polymorphism .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We hypothesize that there is a dynamic process of genetic selection that favors the T allele .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This process of selection started during the last quarter of the 20th century , during which the frequency for mutant homozygous ( TT ) rose significantly from 14 % to 24 % .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We propose that this increase in mutants is due to the inclusion of an external factor that enhances mutant fetal viability .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "If we apply the mathematical model for dynamic selection developed for diploid organisms with sexual reproduction , the T allele could reach to 90 % in seven generations in our population ( Figure 1A ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , this model assumes selection in a constant environment that applies to all individuals in the population studied .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In our case , we suggest that the external factor is related to an increase in folate and vitamin intake in women in periconceptional period and does not affect to all individuals [ 18 , 19 ] .", "tgt": "women [EOS]"}
{"src": "We assume that prediction of a classic selection model in this case is only theoretical .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "On the basis of a competition between alleles in which an environmental factor favors one allele versus the other , the final result would be that predicted by the previous mathematical model .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "In this case , the mutation would have a lower influence on fetal viability ( Figure 1B ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The results showed an increase in mutated genotypes ( CT and TT ) and a strong protection against abortion by the wild type genotype ( CC ) , which is practically non - existent in the SA group .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The frequency of the CC genotype shows no change over the decade studied ( 1980 - 1989 ) , which indicates that folate does not exert a visible effect on this genotype .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , the frequency of the mutated allele increases during this decade , especially in fetuses from abortions , and this increase correlated with the increase of the T allele in the control population .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This finding suggests that the effect of folate is crucial to viability during the early stages of embryonic development , but , even with folate , not all embryos will survive until birth .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "In the folate cycle , it can be observed that 5 , 10 - methyleneTHF availability may be important .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "5 , 10 - methyleneTHF is the substrate for several reactions in the cycle , but two of them ( 5 - methylTHF and thymidilate synthesis ) might be essential for embryo development in folate deficiency conditions .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In both cases , complete or limited MTHFR activity will produce higher or lower 5 , 10 - methyleneTHF availability , which might be an essential factor for embryo development , such that a greater folate levels can compensate the lower enzymatic activity of the mutant .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "We suggest that there is genetic selection in our population for the T allele of the MTHFR - 677C > T polymorphism , whose origin could be an increase in fetal viability during the early stages of embryonic development because of an increase in folate and vitamin intake by women in the periconceptional period that began to be established in Spain in the last quarter of the 20th century [ 18 , 19 ] .", "tgt": "women [EOS]"}

{"src": "Background", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "A major goal in the post - genomic world is to infer protein function from sequence information .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "One popular approach is to classify protein families or domains by grouping homologous sequences and annotating the groups with properties such as general function , intracellular location , three - dimensional structure , conserved sequence patterns or motifs , evolutionary origin , and binding and active sites .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Novel proteins can be characterized quickly by assigning a group via profile search methods .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , more than one family or subfamily may exhibit similarity to overlapping sequence intervals and to a degree that seems convincing ( Figure 1 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Assigning the protein to the correct group not only yields the correct annotations , but may also help to avoid propagating annotation errors and alleviate current issues with mislabelling in protein sequence databases [ 1 , 2 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Here , we examine the problem of making correct domain assignments from the Conserved Domain Database [ 3 , 4 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Domains are evolutionarily conserved units in proteins and frequently correspond to recurrent structural and functional units .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The particular function of a protein depends on its combination of domains ; two - thirds of prokaryotic proteins and 80 % of eukaryotic proteins have more than one domain .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "To create new protein functions , novel domain architectures arise through domain rearrangement and recombination , frequently through gene duplication and fission or fusion events [ 5 , 6 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "A domain may be represented as a multiple sequence alignment ( MSA ) of homologous sequence fragments .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "To identify the domains in a query protein sequence , the MSAs are converted into scoring models such as hidden Markov model or position - specific scoring matrix for use with database search algorithms such HMMER [ 7 ] and RPS - BLAST [ 8 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "To refine protein annotation , domains models may be subdivided to represent more specific functions or conserved features .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "CDD curators apply phylogenetic and structural analysis to construct hierarchies of homologous domain models , related by common descent , to reflect aspects of their evolutionary histories [ 3 , 4 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Curation follows an iterative procedure to split domain models into subfamilies that redistributes sequences into more narrowly defined models .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In the hierarchy tree structure , the leaf domains represent highly conserved and often orthologous protein subgroups .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Their precursor ( internal ) domains , on the other hand , reflect ancient gene duplication events , as CDD aims to categorize ancient conserved domain families .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "It may seem natural that once the profiles have been defined , the most significant match to a query sequence is the correct one .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Indeed , domains from Pfam [ 9 , 10 ] and SMART [ 11 ] are assigned following the lowest alignment E - value that exceeds a family - specific cutoff [ 12 , 13 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This straightforward approach works well when the candidate domains are disjoint .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Domain subfamilies may be obtained through automated methods such as the SCI - PHY algorithm for identifying functional subtypes of known domain families [ 14 , 15 ] or by mirroring other hierarchical domain classifications such as SCOP [ 16 ] and CATH [ 17 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , subfamily assignment methods generally attempt to classify a member of a family at the subfamily level given that the family is known , as in a statistical pairwise / profile method proposed for SUPERFAMILY [ 18 - 20 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The systematic arrangement of CDD domains requires identifying the most suitable level of resolution among domain models that offer more or less fine - grained descriptions of a protein .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We take the viewpoint that if a protein cannot be associated unambiguously with a specific subgroup or may be a member of a subgroup that has not been defined , the protein can be assigned a more generic domain model or the superfamily in general .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "The NCBI - curated domains have undergone rigorous testing to optimize the MSAs and distributions of representative sequence fragments .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The correct or most specific domain for each sequence in a hierarchy is defined as the domain having no descendant that contains an overlapping sequence interval .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Two sequence intervals from one protein are said to overlap if one sequence interval contains at least 30 % of the positions of the other .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "While each sequence has been placed in the most specific domain model that characterizes it , this step is required as parent and child domains share overlapping sequences ( Figure 1 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "We begin by assessing the performance of the previous method for assigning NCBI - curated domains from CDD .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The NCBI CD - Search tool [ 22 ] has historically relied on alignment E - value and properties such as the source domain database to highlight one or a few most likely domain assignments , without claiming to pinpoint the correct domain assignment .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Analysis of all hits to the sequences in the benchmark set reveals that assigning domains by high alignment score alone achieves 96 % accuracy over all sequences and 100 % accuracy over the representative sequences for 91 . 5 % of domain models .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Further , categorizing non - self hits by their hierarchical relationships to the correct domain reveals that assigning to a subclass of the correct domain is the most common type of error when a sequence matches the correct domain and other domains ( Table 1 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "For simplicity , all non - self hits are labelled as incorrect hits in the tables although some child / descendant and parent / ancestor assignments may not be regarded as actual classification errors .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Child / descendant domains score higher than the self hit for 21 . 8 % of sequences with both types of hits .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "These higher scores may reflect computational bias from longer profiles , overly cautious assignment of a sequence to a more generic domain , or missing subfamilies .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In contrast , higher scores from parent / ancestor domains or domains from other branches of a hierarchy are rarely observed .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "For additional data and discussion of all analyses described in this document , see [ Additional file 1 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We define a score threshold for each domain to be the lowest self - hit score to that domain among all of its sequences in the benchmark set .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This additional heuristic , in particular , reduces incorrect assignments to subclasses as only 9 . 1 % of hits to subclasses score above the thresholds for those subclasses ( Table 2 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The threshold definition works around the issue of small data size - over 60 % of domains have 20 or fewer self hits - and addresses variances in scores between domains due to properties such as length and residue composition , or practical issues such as incomplete local alignments , which are not considered by simple high - score heuristics .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The definition is more restrictive than its Pfam counterpart , the minimum alignment score among all sequences in the automated \" full alignment \" , as NCBI - curated hierarchies in CDD tend to present a finer - grained classification of a protein domain family .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Proposed rule for specific domain assignment", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We propose to label a single domain as correct or specific for a protein sequence region if its alignment score is highest among all domains that align to overlapping regions of the protein sequence and the score exceeds a pre - calculated threshold for the domain , defined as the minimum alignment score among confirmed members of the domain .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Sequence intervals that are difficult to group with a specific subclass with high confidence following this rule may receive only generic domain assignments .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Conclusion", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Based on the results from the expert panels , the three major areas of focus for HHR planning in the rehabilitation sector should include strategies addressing Quality of Worklife and Work Environment , Financial Incentives and Marketing and Professional Development .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Background", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Demand for rehabilitation services is expected to increase within the next decade primarily due to factors such as an aging population , workforce pressures , rise in chronic and complex multi - system disorders , advances in technology , and changes in health service delivery models [ 1 - 4 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In Canada , rehabilitation personnel constitute the third largest health professional group after nurses and physicians .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Despite the size of this workforce , studies have consistently reported ongoing shortages of physiotherapists ( PTs ) , occupational therapists ( OTs ) and speech - language pathologists ( SLPs ) across all jurisdictions [ 5 - 7 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Similarly , recruitment and retention of rehabilitation professionals has been considered a challenge internationally , nationally and provincially .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "At the international level , the literature reports recruitment and retention difficulties of rehabilitation therapists in countries such as Australia , New Zealand , United Kingdom and the United States [ 8 - 13 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Provinces across Canada face similar issues ; with Ontario projected to face the most difficulty due to its population growth rate [ 14 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Based on the Canadian Institute for Health Information ' s Health Personnel Trends in Canada from 1993 to 2002 report , numerous factors have been suggested to influence demand for physiotherapy and occupational therapy services .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Factors that may influence increase demand for physiotherapy include : shift in health service delivery models from hospital to community care ; earlier patient discharge ; increased expectations from aging Canadians concerning more active lifestyles ; growing private practice sector and continued shortages for PTs in both private and public sectors in rural , remote and urban settings across Canada [ 2 ] .", "tgt": "patient [EOS]"}
{"src": "In 1993 , an Ontario study stated that in order to meet demands of changing health care policy , medical technology and demographic changes in the population , the PT profession required an annual growth rate of 4 . 4 % until the year 2000 [ 5 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , the national health personnel databases revealed that the actual average annual growth rate of active PTs in Canada from 1995 to 2004 was only 2 . 5 % , approximately half of the projected requirement suggested to meet demand [ 15 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Similarly , in Ontario in the early 1990s an increase in demand for OTs was projected because of the reported shortage in OTs and high attrition rate [ 16 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The shortage of OTs was explained by another Ontario study to be the result of the changing philosophies of care and management for the disabled , and a clearer understanding of the role of OT in the physical and mental well - being of the disabled [ 17 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In terms of actual shortages , some authors have reported ongoing vacancies and recruitment difficulties for OTs [ 11 , 18 ] while others have reported an increase in demand for both PTs [ 19 ] and OTs [ 20 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Speech language pathology is facing similar service demands .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "A report released in March 2003 by the College of Audiologists and Speech - Language Pathologists of Ontario ( CASLPO ) concluded that based on prevalence rates for Ontario residents with speech , language and related disorders , the demand for service would increase by 13 % while the number of SLPs would decrease by 4 % resulting in an overall reduction in service of 15 % [ 21 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The American Speech - Language - Hearing Association ( ASHA ) has been tracking SLP vacancies .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In their 2005 ASHA Speech - Language Pathology Health Care survey , 48 % of respondents indicated that they had funded unfilled positions for SLPS in their agency [ 22 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The same survey also reported that 65 % of respondents in home care indicated that job openings were more numerous than job seekers in their geographic area .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "While labour market demand and supply are influential factors on recruitment and retention decisions , the development of strategies requires an understanding of conceptual frameworks or theories to categorise and explain how other underlying factors impact health worker ' s mobility .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "For example , Lehmann et al . ' s model described that health worker ' s decisions to accept and stay in remote areas in the public sector depends on two interrelated aspects : the impact of the different environments ( i . e . individual , local , work , national and international ) and the location of decision - makers ( i . e . local government , Ministry of Health , HR directorate , public service and other ministries ) [ 23 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Behavioural and social science theories , such as those explained by Tett and Meyer , found that job satisfaction and organizational commitment each contribute independently to the prediction of the intention to resign ( turnover ) , however job satisfaction was a stronger predictor than organizational commitment [ 24 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Based on this notion , considerable research has been devoted to identifying factors that affect job satisfaction among rehabilitation professionals .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "While there is no single , agreed upon model of job satisfaction , a variety of theoretical models have been studied to explain concepts and relationships associated with overall job satisfaction .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The two most commonly used theories of job satisfaction for rehabilitation professionals are the Herzberg ' s Motivation - Hygiene Theory [ 25 ] and Mottaz ' s concepts of work values and work rewards [ 26 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "A number of rehabilitation studies have used the Herzberg ' s Motivation - Hygiene Theory , also known as the two - factor theory of motivation to explain associations between motivation , job satisfaction and retention factors among OTs , PTs and SLPs [ 27 - 31 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Frederick Herzberg et al . explained that there were two independent incidents occurring at peoples ' jobs : one that made them feel good or satisfied , and another that made them feel bad or dissatisfied at work [ 25 ] .", "tgt": "peoples [EOS]"}
{"src": "Intrinsic factors that motivate people such as achievement , recognition , work itself , responsibility , advancement and personal growth were called the \" motivators \" which lead to feelings of satisfaction .", "tgt": "people [EOS]"}
{"src": "Extrinsic factors such as work conditions , company policies , supervision , interpersonal work relations , salary and job security , known as \" hygiene \" factors , were claimed to prevent dissatisfaction .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "\" Motivators \" directly affect a person ' s motivational drive to do a good job , therefore they are believed to be more important than hygiene factors .", "tgt": "person [EOS]"}
{"src": "Mottaz on the other hand , accounted for individual differences in job satisfaction among workers and based his study on two dimensions : \" work rewards \" and \" work values \" [ 26 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "\" Work rewards \" are perceived characteristics of the job and have three conceptual clusters which include task , social and organizational rewards [ 26 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Mottaz describes \" task rewards \" ( intrinsic ) as having five independent characteristics including : skill variety , task identity , task significance , autonomy and feedback .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Examples include interesting and challenging work , self - direction and responsibility , creativity , opportunities to use one ' s skills and feedback .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In the same study , Mottaz stated that \" social rewards \" ( extrinsic ) are derived from the interpersonal relationships established with others at work .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Having supportive colleagues and supervisors is an example of this dimension .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Lastly , \" organizational rewards \" ( extrinsic ) are tangible rewards that are provided by the employer / organization to facilitate performance .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Such factors include working conditions , pay and fringe benefits , career advancement and security .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The second dimension of job satisfaction is based on \" work values \" , which is the importance that individuals place on their work rewards [ 26 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "For example , some rehabilitation therapists may value extrinsic rewards such as pay and benefits as more important than intrinsic factors like clinical autonomy and challenging work .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Although the Herzberg and Mottaz conceptual frameworks are organized differently , their job satisfaction variables are very similar ( i . e . work conditions , pay , interpersonal relationships , etc . ) and they both classify these factors as having intrinsic or extrinsic elements .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Despite the growing body of literature on recruitment and retention factors in various industries , there is a minimal amount of research studying these factors specifically among rehabilitation professionals .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "One published study however , did look at extrinsic and intrinsic job satisfaction factors on recruitment and retention of rehabilitation professionals ( OTs , PTs and SLPs ) [ 32 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Results from this study showed that intrinsic factors such as professional growth and having a work environment in line with personal values are more significant in predicting career satisfaction than extrinsic factors such as pay and continuing education .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "These same intrinsic factors are also significant in predicting retention in rehabilitation professionals .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Another study looking at recruitment and retention of allied health professionals in the rural areas in New South Wales identified that the main reasons why people liked working in rural areas were because of the attractive environment and helpful team members [ 33 ] .", "tgt": "people [EOS]"}
{"src": "However 82 % of employees reported that having their partner move away was the number one reason for leaving a rural job .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "A similar study was conducted among OTs and PTs in Northwestern Ontario [ 34 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Findings from this study indicated that factors contributing to initial decision on location of practice include availability of leisure / recreation activities , proximity of family origin and influences of spouse / partners .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Study results also showed that the main reasons therapists left their job were to be closer to their family , lack of job opportunity and spousal influence .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Solely understanding factors that influence recruitment and retention decisions is not sufficient in the development of a HHR plan for rehabilitation professionals .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In order for the plan to be effective and sustainable in addressing these factors , the most important and feasible workforce strategies needs to be identified .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "There have been a number of reports on health human resources ( HHR ) planning , recruitment and retention strategies for physicians [ 35 , 36 ] and nurses [ 37 ] , however information regarding rehabilitation professionals is lacking .", "tgt": "human [EOS]"}
{"src": "Canadian reports indicate that the main reason for significant gaps in this field is the absence of current and reliable data available on supply , demand and labour force participation trends for rehabilitation therapists [ 38 - 40 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "There is some research that has investigated theoretical models of job satisfaction on recruitment and retention [ 28 , 32 ] ; however few studies have looked at how these models have been implemented .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Other studies have examined the relationship of gender , workplace setting ( i . e . hospital , ambulatory , rehabilitation , acute and long - term care ) and geographical location ( i . e . rural or urban ) on job satisfaction and retention among rehabilitation professionals [ 41 - 43 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Furthermore , no empirical studies have examined conceptual frameworks for organizing recruitment and retention strategies for rehabilitation therapists .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "To address this gap , this research identified recruitment and retention strategies from the literature for rehabilitation professionals and determined their importance and feasibility using expert panels .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Phase 1 : Literature Review", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Identification of recruitment and retention strategies", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "A review of the literature was conducted to identify recruitment and retention strategies for rehabilitation therapists .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In this study , rehabilitation professionals were defined as physical therapists ( PTs ) , occupational therapists ( OTs ) and speech - language pathologists ( SLPs ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Both published and non - empirical literature was accessed in this review .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Keywords used to search for relevant published studies in the Consolidated International Nursing and Allied Health Sciences Library ( CINAHL ) ( 1982 to 2005 ) and Medline ( 1996 to 2005 ) included : \" health human resources or health manpower \" , \" rehabilitation or rehabilitation professionals or vocational \" , \" allied health professionals or personnel \" , \" recruitment strategies \" , \" retention strategies \" , \" physical therapist or physiotherapist \" , \" occupational therapy or occupational therapist \" , \" speech - language pathologist or speech - language pathology \" .", "tgt": "human [EOS]"}
{"src": "Non - empirical literature searches were made on international and national on - line catalogues and publications from health organizations , professional associations , and hospital and home care organizations .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Organization and consolidation of strategies", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "There was a paucity of peer - reviewed studies obtained exploring rehabilitation HHR strategies , therefore the majority of strategies were selected from grey literature reports from international , national and provincial health organizations .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "From the literature review , 107 potential strategies were identified according to their relevance to HHR issues for rehabilitation in Ontario .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "These strategies were then categorized into two broad groups : A ) Recruitment and Retention ( n = 73 ) , and B ) Education ( n = 34 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The majority of strategies were not specific to rehabilitation professionals and they were reviewed by a group of three individuals collectively ( rehabilitation researcher , manager , and clinician ) for duplication , clarity , action focused properties and appropriateness to the Canadian or Ontario setting .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "When necessary , a small number of strategies were re - worded to be relevant to a rehabilitation context .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This analysis resulted in the selection of 40 Recruitment and Retention and 24 Education strategies .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Only 14 recruitment and retention and six education strategies were obtained from peer - reviewed articles .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Since the majority of strategies were identified from the grey literature , it was not surprising that there was no apriori peer - reviewed conceptual framework that reflected the breadth of the strategies obtained from the literature review .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "As a result , the themes used by the Health and Community Services Human Resources Sector Study in Newfoundland and Labrador [ 44 ] formed the basis for the organizational framework for this study since they aligned with the identified strategies .", "tgt": "Human [EOS]"}
{"src": "Each group was further categorized into the five themes ( three for Recruitment and Retention and two for Education ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The three Recruitment and Retention strategy themes were : ( 1 ) Quality of Worklife and Work Environment [ n = 19 ] ; ( 2 ) Workload and Skill Mix [ n = 6 ] ; and ( 3 ) Financial Incentives and Marketing [ n = 15 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Participant Selection", "tgt": "Participant [EOS]"}
{"src": "Once this study was approved by the Research Ethics Board at the University of Toronto , key informants who participated in a previous study regarding rehabilitation supply and demand at the University of Toronto [ 21 ] were asked to nominate potential participants for the panels .", "tgt": "participants [EOS]"}
{"src": "The selection criteria considered were acknowledged leadership in the panel member ' s specialty , expertise in recruitment and retention or education and training of rehabilitation professionals .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Absence of conflicts of interest , geographic diversity , and diversity of practice setting were also considered .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "After purposefully selecting the initial list of candidates from among the nominations , each nominee was contacted to establish their interest and availability .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Expert Panel Process : Round 1 Survey", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "A modified - delphi technique was then used for the expert panel process , [ 46 , 47 ] based on the RAND / UCLA appropriateness method [ 45 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In round 1 , members of the Recruitment and Retention panel were sent an electronic survey containing the 40 strategies identified from the literature review and the Education panelists were also sent an electronic survey with 24 strategies .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "For Round 1 , each panel was asked to rate the strategies using a nine - point Likert - type rating scale that ranged from \" none \" ( 1 ) to \" maximum \" ( 9 ) , on two key dimensions : Feasibility and Importance .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Importance was defined as how valuable , appropriate and useful the strategy could be for rehabilitation HHR planning in Ontario .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "At the end of the survey , panelists were given the opportunity to suggest additional strategies that they felt were appropriate to consider .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Among these selected strategies , the majority were classified under Quality of Worklife and Work Environment ( 44 % ) and Financial Incentives and Marketing ( 44 % ) , followed by Workload and Skill Mix ( 12 % ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "It should be noted that some strategies had equal rankings ; therefore the total number of rankings did not equal the total number of strategies .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Recruitment and retention strategies that had a combination of high and medium ratings in either of the two dimensions included : sense of empowerment in promoting healthy work environments ; team - building exercises ; developing participatory decision - making systems ; improving rural working conditions ; recognizing work - life balance ; creating an environment where staff are valued ; optimizing scope of practice and work - management autonomy .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Strategies that had medium importance and feasibility ratings included : resolving concerns about liability and accountability in collaborative practice ; recruiting international trained therapists ; opportunity to work in different settings ; interprofessional payment schemes ; family leave ; staff recognition and creating a position for a provincial health professional recruiter .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Low importance and feasibility strategies included : word of mouth references ; bursaries and retention bonuses ; exchange employment opportunities ; health promotion ; retention workshop ; 80 - 20 staffing model ( 80 % clinical and 20 % learning new skills or training others ) ; using recruitment agencies and providing recruitment bonuses ( Table 4 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "The majority of strategies in this group tend to be in the area of Professional Development ( 72 % ) , more so than Education and Training ( 28 % ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The medium rated education strategies included : expand interprofessional education ; provide incentives for students interested in rural practice ; summer mentorship programs for high school students ; and aboriginal student support program .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The strategies that were considered neither feasible nor important included : using return of service contracts after professional development ; create a tiered pathway approach through modular education and laddered credentialing and in accreditation standards allow greater use of rural practice sites ( Table 6 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Since the purpose of the panel was to identify recruitment and retention and education strategies that could inform the development of a HHR plan for rehabilitation professionals , there was also discussion about contextual factors that would influence a plan .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Discussion", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The purpose of this study was to identify recruitment and retention strategies to inform the development of HHR planning for rehabilitation professionals in Ontario .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This study highlights that Quality of Worklife and Work Environment , Financial Incentives and Marketing and Professional Development are the three major areas of focus when developing a competitive HR plan in the rehabilitation sector .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Quality of Worklife and Work Environment", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Quality of Worklife and Work Environment strategies ranked among the top category for recruitment and retention of rehabilitation therapists .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This has also been found among nurses [ 44 ] where it was reported that addressing such factors can affect the overall success of the program [ 49 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Specifically , our findings showed that the top ranked strategy for both importance and feasibility was improving and maintaining the safety of rehabilitation professionals in the workplace .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Specific strategies that could reduce aggression , abuse and violence in the workplace include : zero tolerance policies , access to employee support programs and providing assistance to rehabilitation professionals who work alone ( i . e . home care and rural and remote areas ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Since there is less control over the environment in the home care setting , safety may become a greater concern in one practice setting over another .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This might suggest that because there is less control in environments such as home care , remote areas , and psychiatric settings , maintaining safety will be more difficult and that solutions will need to be tailored to these settings in order to ensure retention of providers .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Although no studies have looked at implementing personal safety strategies for home care therapists , written policies and procedures for home care nurses during inclement weather and for dealing with abusive or dangerous patients , families and neighbourhoods have been reported [ 50 ] .", "tgt": "patients [EOS]"}
{"src": "In addition to the above , ensuring open and timely communication between employer and worker was also ranked highly among the recruitment and retention strategies .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Examples of strategies include : open door policies , employee advisory committees and regular staff meetings and evaluations .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Although these strategies were reported to be used among organizations providing services to persons with developmental disabilities in Alberta , there was no description of the organizations , sample size or methodology [ 51 ] .", "tgt": "persons [EOS]"}
{"src": "Similar findings were found in a qualitative study among 16 nurses working from diverse practice settings ( acute , long - term care , rehabilitation and community ; from both urban and rural areas ) in a health region in western Canada .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "From the semi - structured interviews , study participants expressed a desire for improved consultation and communication with nurses regarding changes to the health care system [ 52 ] .", "tgt": "participants [EOS]"}
{"src": "Financial Incentives and Marketing", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Another area that was ranked highly was marketing strategies to increase high school student and public awareness of rehabilitation careers .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "These specific strategies were also recommended by the Ontario Hospital Association ( OHA ) in order to establish a competitive position for Ontario hospitals in respect of recruitment and retention of health care professionals [ 53 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Similar strategies have been developed by the American Physical Therapy Association ( APTA ) in response to the declining number of students applying to Physical Therapy Education Programs [ 54 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "To address this trend , APTA developed a campaign to promote Physical Therapy as the profession of choice to high school and college students across the United States .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The potential components of their plan included : developing a \" Recruiting Kit \" for educators , students and various APTA members to be used in the high school and college settings to introduce Physical Therapy as a career ; establishing public relations initiatives that demonstrate the role of Physical Therapy in the public arena targeting minority groups that are underrepresented in the profession ; and creating alliances with professional associations of high school guidance counsellors and educators .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Based on our finding , the APTA model may have applicability in Ontario .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Workload and Skill Mix", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Of the six Workload and Skill Mix strategies only two were highly rated : implementing a caseload management database and using support personnel .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Caseload management has been identified in the literature as an issue affecting all three rehabilitation professions .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "For example , in physiotherapy , Christie ' s study [ 55 ] found that caseload expectations tended to be significantly higher than the reality and that caseload varies across different programs .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Similarly , the Canadian Association of Speech - Language Pathologists and Audiologists ( CASPLA ) survey indicated that factors affecting the workload of SLPs include delivery models , client disorder , severity and work setting [ 56 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "A literature review and environmental scan undertaken by the Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists ( CAOT ) proposed that guiding principles for caseload management should include : evidence - based occupational therapy , cost - effectiveness , accountability , professional leadership and expert judgment , comprehensiveness and flexibility [ 57 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Therefore , upon implementation of a caseload management database for rehabilitation , key factors to consider include workplace setting and client service delivery models .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The other highly rated Workload and Skill Mix strategy was the use of support personnel ( i . e . physiotherapy assistants or exercise therapists ) to increase efficiency of utilization of scarcer and higher order rehabilitation competencies .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Considerations for implementing this strategy include addressing key issues such supply , standards of education , standards of practice and accreditation .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "These are highlighted in an article by Salvatori [ 58 ] who reported that the actual number of OT personnel delivering OT services in Canada remains unknown and that there are no national standards of education nor accreditation process for OT assistants .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "CAOT believes that in order to utilize support personnel appropriately , studies on human resource needs for occupational therapy and support personnel are first needed with input from OTs , stakeholders , funders , decision makers and health policy planners [ 59 ] .", "tgt": "human [EOS]"}
{"src": "Since there is a lack of competency profiles related to the role , responsibilities , and supervision of assistants , particularly with regards to delivering services in unsupervised community - based settings , the type of workplace setting where this strategy may be implemented should be considered [ 58 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Education and Training", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Given that 60 % of highly rated Education and Training strategies targeted rural and remote practices underscores the importance of specific strategies for rural and remote areas in the development of a HHR plan .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The need to build on existing mechanisms to expand the availability of rural and remote clinical placements by providing financial and accommodation support was ranked among the top two most important and feasible education strategies for rehabilitation professionals .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Not only has this strategy been used as a recruitment tool for rehabilitation students , it has also been reported by Solomon et al .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "[ 34 ] to be effective in retaining OTs and PTs in underserviced Northwestern Ontario communities .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Respondents from Solomon et al . ' s study reported that the top three benefits of supervising students were that it stimulates thinking , it provides opportunity to contribute to the profession and that it provides access to current information .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The reported disadvantages however was that it was time - consuming and students contributed stress to the working environment .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Similarly , a two - part study found substantial gaps between financial incentives students deem important in the creation of an appealing clinical placement opportunity and the actual provisions offered to them by Southeastern Ontario communities [ 60 , 61 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Although OT and PT students reported that they were more willing to complete a clinical placement in an underserviced community if provided travel stipends , rent - free housing and interprofessional education opportunities , the majority of these incentives were only available to medical students .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In addition to training students for rural and remote practice , a longitudinal study reported that perceived opportunity for career development was the most significant factor related to job turnover and regional attrition among physiotherapists working in Northern Ontario [ 5 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Therefore developing workforce strategies for rehabilitation therapists working in these areas should be among one of the priority areas in HHR planning .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Professional Development", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Our findings indicate that the theme with the largest number of strategies that were considered important and feasible to implement as part of HHR planning was professional development .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Many were specific to rural and remote areas .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Although the importance of continuous professional development ( CPD ) in recruitment and retention is well recognized , a Canadian study reported several barriers to its implementation [ 62 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In the case of OTs employed in public settings in Nova Scotia , Townsend et al .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "( 2006 ) found that the most powerful deterrent for CPD was the lack of support from workplace policies .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Based on their study results , the use of CPD as a recruitment and retention strategy was highly influenced by gender issues , work - life balance , career advancement , working conditions , geographical location , professional versus employer responsibility , and employee benefits .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Although occupational therapy is a female - dominated profession , workplace policies did not address issues of gender .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "For example , therapists in this study indicated that CPD competes with family commitments , therefore these activities are \" done largely during personal time , mainly at their own cost , and on top of childcare , eldercare , homemaking and other family responsibilities \" [ 62 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In addition , heavy workloads , lack of salary and career incentives , and lack of policy and funding support are all barriers to CPD .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "These issues become more pronounced in rural and remote settings because smaller communities often only have one therapist ; hence the systemic pressure of workload demands makes it difficult for the therapist to leave patient care .", "tgt": "patient [EOS]"}
{"src": "OTs from this study also questioned who was responsible for CPD .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Some felt that it was the professional ' s responsibility while others felt that it was the responsibility of the employer to provide CPD opportunities .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The primary limitation employers faced was the lack of financial resources , however giving employees time off without pay was an alternative strategy utilized instead of funding professional development activities .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Although there are professional and provincial variations in funding for CPD across Canada , these results are informative in that it highlights the need for employers to consider how workplace policies can affect recruitment and retention strategies .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Limitations of this study should be noted .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "First , the majority of the strategies were obtained from the grey literature that is not subject to the same scrutiny as the peer - reviewed literature .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Second , almost none of the strategies were specifically developed for rehabilitation professionals and in many cases had to be re - worded to fit the rehabilitation context .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "There is a lack of research on rehabilitation clinicians ' perspectives on recruitment and retention strategies ; therefore future research should focus on investigating this area .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Third , during the face - to - face meeting , bias could have resulted from panelists whose opinion may have influenced others significantly , especially if members came from similar workplace settings .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The facilitator of the expert panels however , followed a strict process for managing the discussion and ensured that all panelists were given the opportunity to express their opinions .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Finally , although some strategies such as competitive wage packages , training / growth opportunities and professional development are viewed as both a recruitment and retention incentive , other strategies do not overlap and are appropriate for only one of the two tasks .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "For example , increasing public awareness of rehabilitation careers , providing rural and remote orientation packages and family relocation programs are only appropriate for attracting a worker while ensuring open and timely communication may be seen as a strategy only for retention .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Future research should therefore consider studying recruitment and retention strategies separately so that a distinction between the two can be made .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Interestingly , the loss of Ngn2 at early stages of development leads to a robust reduction in neurogenesis , but does not disturb granule neuron maturation per se .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We found that the role of Ngn2 is to maintain progenitors in an undifferentiated state , allowing them to amplify prior to their maturation into granule neurons upon NeuroD1 induction .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Introduction", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Neurons are born not only during development of the central nervous system , but neurogenesis also continues into adulthood .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In both rodent and human adult brain , neurogenesis is active in two distinct zones of the forebrain : the subventricular zone ( SVZ ) of the lateral ventricle and the subgranular zone ( SGZ ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus ( DG ) [ 1 ] - [ 5 ] .", "tgt": "rodent [SEP] human [EOS]"}

{"src": "In the adult hippocampus , Pax6 is expressed in astrocytes in the SGZ and are considered to be the true stem cells [ 9 ] , [ 11 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Loss - and gain - of - function studies indicate that Pax6 is involved in regulating the proliferation of neocortical and hippocampal progenitors [ 9 ] , [ 12 ] - [ 16 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "During neocorticogenesis , high concentrations of Pax6 induce the expression of the bHLH transcription factor Neurogenin2 ( Ngn2 ) [ 17 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In turn , Ngn2 causes cell cycle exit [ 18 ] , an event that takes place when NeuroD1 starts to be expressed [ 19 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In the developing hippocampus , the absence of Ngn2 leads to a reduced number of granule neurons [ 20 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "NeuroD1 , on the other hand , is essential for the differentiation and survival of hippocampal granule neurons [ 10 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Interestingly , in the absence of Ngn2 , NeuroD1 can still be activated and neuronal differentiation can still take place [ 20 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This has led to the idea that the primary role of Ngn2 is not to direct neuronal differentiation .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Only a small number of studies have addressed the role of Ngn2 and NeuroD1 in hippocampal neurogenesis [ 10 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Therefore , we now re - examine their roles in hippocampal neurogenesis in detail , using gain - and loss - of - function experiments .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We first establish a hierarchy of transcriptional events that occur during neurogenesis in the DG and then define the place that Ngn2 , NeuroD1 and other transcription factors have in this cascade .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We find that a lack of Ngn2 expression result in a markedly smaller hippocampus and an almost complete absence of the DG .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "These radial glia - like stem cells divide relatively infrequently , and are believed to undergo symmetric division ( giving rise to two identical stem cells ) under some conditions .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Based on a previous report [ 24 ] , we examined the expression pattern of the T - domain transcription factors Tbr1 and Tbr2 .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We found that Tbr2 is expressed in type - 2a cells , in agreement with a recent report [ 25 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In the SGZ of 2 week - old mice , we found an average of 50 - 70 Tbr2 + cells per 30 micro m - thick section throughout the rostro - caudal axis of the dorsal hippocampus .", "tgt": "mice [EOS]"}
{"src": "This number was reduced by 35 % in 2 month - old mice ( Figure 1C with figure S1C and data not shown ) .", "tgt": "mice [EOS]"}
{"src": "As opposed to Tbr1 ( Figure 1D and figure S1D ) , Tbr2 + cells did not co - express Dcx or PSA - NCAM ( Figure 1C and figure S1C ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We observed that Tbr1 - immuoreactivity gradually decreased as neurons matured and started to express NeuN ( Figure 1H and figure S1H ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Thus , Tbr2 labels type - 2 cells , while Tbr1 is expressed by immature granule neurons .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We then examined the molecular phenotype of type - 3 cells , a cell type that transiently expresses Calretinin [ 26 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We hypothesized that hippocampal type - 3 cells might also express the bHLH transcription factor NeuroD1 , known to partially overlap with Tbr2 and Tbr1 in different brain regions [ 24 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "We found that NeuroD1 expression in the hippocampus starts in Tbr2 + cells and extends to post - mitotic Tbr1 + cells , which also express the hippocampal granule identity transcription factor Prox1 ( Figure 1G and 1I and figure S1G and S1I ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumor of the kidney is a rare entity .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The few cases reported revealed a variable presentation and an aggressive behaviour .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The distinction from other primary malignancies of the kidneys is crucial for prognosis .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The differential diagnosis includes extra - osseous Ewing ' s sarcoma , rhabdomyosarcoma , Wilm ' s tumor , carcinoid , neuroblastoma , clear cell sarcoma of the kidney , lymphoma , the small cell variant of osteosarcoma , desmoplastic small round cell tumor and nephroblastoma [ 5 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The Homer - Wright type rosettes , commonly scarce of number or less defined in extra skeletal Ewing ' s sarcoma ( ES ) , are a typical histological feature for PNET and can address the diagnosis although they can be found also in neuroblastoma [ 5 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "To better address the diagnosis , an immunohistochemical analysis is necessary .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In our case the presence of MIC - 2 gene products , known also as CD99 , 12E7 , E2 , 013 and HBA71 , suggested a PNET diagnosis .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Primitive neuroectodermal tumors only immunorreactive to CD99 , even if uncommon , are reported in the literature [ 13 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The reactivity to vimentin , NSE and S - 100 may facilitate the diagnosis but is not patognomonic , while CD 99 positivity is nowadays a clue for the diagnosis .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Moreover cytogenetic studies ( not performed in our case ) demonstrated that PNET and Ewing ' s sarcoma can both be associated to a translocation of the long arms of chromosome 11 and 22 , t ( 11 ; 22 ) ( q22 ; q12 ) [ 5 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Despite their genetic and antigenic similarity , many authors currently recognize PNET and extra - skeletal Ewing ' s sarcoma of the kidney as separate entities .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "It is also important to keep separate renal PNET and malignant rhabdomyosarcoma tumor ( MRT ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Weeks et al reported 8 cases suggestive for PNET but mimicking MRT [ 14 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Although renal PNET and MRT show similar clinico - pathological features , the latter usually occurs in very young children , having a more aggressive prognosis .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Rodriguez et al postulated that these two renal neoplasms share a common undifferentiated precursor to explain their similarity and we agree with these Authors [ 12 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Indeed , the hypothesis that tumors arise from stem cells ( SCs ) as a consequence of a maturative arrest is now growing [ 15 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "SCs are present in almost all tissues and may originate different cellular lineages by the multi - step process named \" differentiation \" .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The role of SCs in tumorigenesis was clearly demonstrated in a number of carcinogenic models showing that solid and haematopoietic cancers could arise from tissue - specific SCs [ 16 - 19 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In agreement with Sell and Pierce , we retain that the degree of malignancy of a carcinoma depends by the stage in which SCs differentiation stopped during carcinogenesis [ 19 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In particular , since PNET , Ewing ' s tumour and MRT have a similar morphology , our hypothesis is that the mesenchimal stem precursor of these tumors is the same , but the stage of differentiation in which it is blocked is different .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "The mannose 6 - phosphate / insulin - like growth factor - II receptor ( M6P / IGF2R ) is a unique protein that interacts with multiple ligands , some of which are important growth regulatory factors [ 1 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The M6P / IGF2R participates in internalization and lysosomal degradation of IGF - II , a mitogen normally acting through the IGF - I receptor to stimulate cell proliferation [ 2 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Cardiac myocytes express relatively high levels of M6P / IGF2R and transgenic mice containing a homologous deletion of the M6P / IGF2R gene manifest ventricular hyperplasia due to an increase in cell number [ 9 , 10 ] , suggesting that the M6P / IGF2R normally acts to suppress cardiac myocyte cell growth .", "tgt": "mice [EOS]"}

{"src": "MTT analysis and viable cell counts showed that ribozyme - mediated down - regulation of M6P / IGF2R resulted in a marked increase in cell proliferation of cardiomyocytes , which normally express high levels of M6P / IGF2R [ 20 ] and have limited proliferative capabilities [ 21 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "These results are consistent with the findings of previous knockout studies [ 9 , 10 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Since the M6P / IGF2R has multiple actions on cell growth , its proliferative effect on the heart cells observed in this study might involve multiple mechanisms .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , it is likely that unchecked IGF - II stimulation plays a key role in the effect .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Because the M6P / IGF2R is believed to sequester and degrade IGF - II [ 2 ] , a decrease in M6P / IGF2R expression and function could result in decreased degradation and hence increased bioavailability of IGF - II to the IGF - I receptor , which mediates the growth - promoting effect of IGF - II .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "Our results showing that ribozyme - mediated down - regulation of M6P / IGF2R lead to a decrease in IGF - II internalization support the above possibility .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , further investigation to confirm this mechanism is warranted .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "More importantly , our results also showed that M6P / IGF2R down - regulation resulted in decreased sensitivity of cardiomyocytes to hypoxia - and TNF - induced apoptosis .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "The M6P / IGF2R has been shown to be involved in binding , transport and activation of lysosomal enzymes , including cathepsins [ 4 , 5 ] .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Therefore , it is possible that down - regulation of the M6P / IGF2R results in improper trafficking and activation of cathepsins .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This , in turn would eliminate the apoptotic cascades triggered by these enzymes under hypoxia and TNF stimulation and result in decreased sensitivity of cardiomyocytes to apoptosis .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}

{"src": "INTRODUCTION", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Searching for conserved domains has become an integral part of several bioinformatics data analysis pipelines .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The Pfam protein families database [ ( 1 ) ; http : / / pfam . wustl . edu ] contains the single largest public collection of conserved functional domains and hence is integrated into many bioinformatics resources .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The current version ( release 12 ) of the Pfam - A database contains 7316 HMM domains , making it an indispensable resource for protein functional annotation ( 2 ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "However , the size of the Pfam database is quite large ( ~ 600 MB ) and genome - scale searching of protein sequences against this database is a highly compute - intensive task .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Hence , with the exception of the Sanger Center web server ( http : / / www . sanger . ac . uk / Software / Pfam ) , all other Pfam - searching servers permit submission of only one protein sequence at a time ( http : / / pfam . wustl . edu , http : / / pfam . jouy . inra . fr , http : / / pfam . cgb . ki . se ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Currently , the Sanger Center web server limits batch submission to 1000 sequences at a time .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Other than this , for batch searching , users are required to install the Pfam database and the HMMER software [ ( 3 ) ; http : / / hmmer . wustl . edu ) locally .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Given the size and dynamic nature of this database ( 14 updates in the last two years ) , it is not convenient to maintain the latest versions of these tools locally .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Moreover , the hmmpfam program used for searching the Pfam database is very slow and memory intensive ( on Solaris machines , the processing speed is about 10 sequences per 1 h of CPU time ) , making this process a bottleneck in several data analysis pipelines .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Web servers that enable batch searching of the Pfam database are extremely beneficial to the user community , especially to those without local access to high - end computational power , memory and disk space .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "To this end we have developed a parallelized version , as well as an optimized single - processor version , of hmmpfam from release 2 . 3 . 2 of the HMMER software , as described in the next section .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Using these programs , we present the SledgeHMMER web server ( http : / / SledgeHmmer . sdsc . edu ) , which is capable of batch searching a large number of protein sequences concurrently .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The current web service is mainly intended for genome - scale searching of the Pfam - A database .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Searches are possible for different Pfam - searching modes such as local , glocal and merged , using either gathering or E - value thresholds .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "To expedite the response time , we developed a database containing pre - calculated Pfam search results .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Query sequences are matched against the pre - calculated entries using hexadecimal hashing methods from the MD5 Perl module , and those without matches are separated out .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Results for matching sequences are retrieved from the pre - calculated database while , for other sequences , a new search process is initiated using our improved hmmpfam program .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Results are emailed in a space - delimited tabular format upon completion of the search .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Parallelizing the hmmpfam algorithm", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Computing batch searches against the Pfam database is a two - dimensional ( 2D ) problem , i . e . searching N query sequences against M Pfam HMMs .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Thus , this problem can be parallelized across any dimension or across both dimensions .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "A minor disadvantage of parallelizing across the M dimension is that a global gather needs to be performed at the end of the computation to identify the best matched HMM models .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Along the N dimension the computation is completely independent , however ; due to the variation in the query sequence lengths , the traditional message passing interface ( MPI ) technique of splitting the file into equal numbers of sequences may result in load imbalance .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Hence , the best way to parallelize code along the N dimension is to stripmine the query sequences as the processors finish working on their previous ones .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This can be achieved using an MPI technique in which one processor reads the query sequence file and sends the sequences to all others .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Here , we have parallelized the HMMER code along the N dimension ( query sequences ) using a Unix - based file - locking technique .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This implementation requires all the processors , nodes and computers working on a single problem to have access to a file system that honors Unix file locking .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "So far , we have tested the implementation on AIX , Linux , NFS and GPFS file systems and found our program to work correctly .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The advantages of parallelizing with file locking are that ( i ) new processes can join or leave the process pool in the middle of computing ; ( ii ) almost perfect load balancing can be achieved ; ( iii ) processors with different clock speeds running different operating systems can be part of the same pool ; and ( iv ) systems do not need to have MPI or parallel virtual machine ( PVM ) installed .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Since the parallelized subroutines are written in a separate file as function calls , very little change is needed to the original HMMER code .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "These parallel routines are generic and , hence , can be used to parallelize other programs with similar computational requirements , such as the BLAST suite of programs .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "A brief description of the parallel function calls is provided below .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "All the processes joining the work pool will call", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The first process that calls this subroutine will create the lockFile and write the starting index .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "This is the index from which sequence stripmining happens .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The rest of the processes open the file stream to the lockFile .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Then , inside the main work loop , every process calls", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "resulting in every process getting a unique next available job ( index ) .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Each process computes the homology search for the sequence index matching the unique index obtained .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "These steps are iterated until no more sequences are left in the query sequence file .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "Outside the work loop at the end , all the processes call", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "which will close the lockFile .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "The user has to ensure a unique lockFile for each new query sequence file .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "If for some reason the work pool is stopped in the middle of a query sequence file , it can continue from the same point by using the same lockFile .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
{"src": "In this version of the hmmpfam program , all processes write search results to a single output file .", "tgt": " [EOS]"}
